Presents the key aspects of interdependence, the twelve links of causation, and cyclic existence (samsara). Outlines the significance of Pratityasamutpada in understanding causality, no-self (anatta), liberation, and ethical behavior, followed by the research question and hypothesis that frames the paper's investigation.\nwww.ijcrt.org                                                              \u00a9 2023 IJCRT | Volume 11, Issue 10 October 2023 | ISSN: 2320-2882 \nIJCRT2310409 \nInternational Journal of Creative Research Thoughts (IJCRT) www.ijcrt.org \nd627 \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nBuddhism's central idea is called pratityasamutpada, often known as dependent origination or dependent arising. \nIt is a fundamental principle of Buddhism that clarifies the causality and interconnection of all things in the cycle \nof existence (samsara). Theravada and Mahayana schools of Buddhism are especially linked to this doctrine. This \nis a brief summary of the idea: \n\uf0b7 Interdependence: According to Pratityasamutpada, everything and everything that happens is dependent \non a variety of factors, including causes and conditions. Everything exists in relation to something else; \nthere is no intrinsic, independent self or substance. \n\uf0b7 The Twelve Links: A chain of twelve interconnected links that depicts the cycle of suffering and rebirth is \nfrequently used to illustrate the idea. The six senses, contact, sensation, craving, attachment, becoming, old \nage, and death are among the connections between ignorance, mental formations, consciousness, name and \nform, and becoming. These connections show how ignorance causes pain and reincarnation and how \nsevering the connection can result in freedom. \n\uf0b7 Pratityasamutpada provides an explanation of the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth, also known as cyclic \nexistence (samsara). It clarifies how ignorance, desire, and attachment all contribute to suffering and how \novercoming these causes can help one escape the cycle. \n \nSignificance in Buddhist Philosophy: \n \n\uf0b7 Knowing Causality: Pratityasamutpada offers a thorough framework for comprehending the circumstances \nand causes that result in suffering. It clarifies the significant role that attachment, craving, and ignorance \nplay in sustaining suffering and the cycle of rebirth. \n\uf0b7 The idea of No-Self (Anatta) emphasizes the Buddhist concept of anatta, which is the absence of a stable, \nunchanging self. It disproves the idea of a stable, eternal \"I\" by demonstrating how interdependent and \ndynamic all phenomena are. \n\uf0b7 Path to Liberation: The Pratityasamutpada provides a real-world route to liberation; it is not merely a \ntheoretical idea. Nirvana, the ultimate goal of Buddhist practice, is the state of not suffering anymore. It \ncan be attained by breaking the cycle of dependent origination. \n\uf0b7 Ethical Implications: In Buddhism, moral and ethical behavior is based on an understanding of \ninterdependence and the effects of one's actions, or karma. Practitioners are urged to behave wisely since \ntheir choices have a profound impact on both other people and themselves. \n \n\"How does an in-depth analysis of the concept of Pratityasamutpada (Dependent Origination) in Buddhist \nphilosophy enhance our comprehension of the intricate web of causality and its pivotal role in the attainment \nof liberation from suffering and cyclic existence?\" \n \nHypothesis: \n \n\"We hypothesize that a comprehensive exploration of Pratityasamutpada will reveal that a profound understanding \nof its principles is essential for deciphering the complex mechanisms of causality and that this understanding, when \napplied, can serve as a transformative framework guiding individuals towards liberation from the cycle of suffering \nin accordance with Buddhist teachings.\"",

One can better understand how every thought, action, and event is connected to a vast network of \ncauses and conditions by doing a thorough analysis. Understanding this interconnectedness is essential to \ncomprehending the complex and subtle ways that causality functions in our daily lives. \n\uf0b7 Bringing the Cycle of Suffering to Light: Pratityasamutpada clarifies the particular causes and \ncircumstances that result in suffering in order to explain the cycle of suffering (samsara). By examining \nthis idea, one can determine the underlying factors that contribute to suffering, such as desire, ignorance, \nand attachment, and comprehend how these factors maintain the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. \n\uf0b7 Offering a Route to Emancipation: By carefully examining Pratityasamutpada, people can acquire \nunderstanding of the ways in which suffering can be overcome. Practitioners can attempt to break the cycle \nof dependent origination by identifying the links in the chain. Liberation begins with an understanding of \nthe causes of suffering, which enables people to confront and eradicate these causes. \n\uf0b7 Pratityasamutpada emphasizes the transient and constantly evolving character of all phenomena. This \ninsight serves as a helpful reminder that nothing is static, which is essential for understanding causality. \nUnderstanding the impermanence of causes and conditions can help people navigate the dynamic interplay \nof causality. Causes and conditions are always changing. \n\uf0b7 Promoting Ethical Living: A deeper awareness of one's ethical obligations can result from studying \nPratityasamutpada. Realizing that one's actions within the web of causality have far-reaching effects \ninspires people to act with greater skill, fostering positive karma and reducing negative effects on others \nand oneself. \n \nIn conclusion, a thorough examination of Buddhist philosophy's Pratityasamutpada is a useful tool for deciphering \ncausality's intricate workings and realizing how crucial it is to the path of emancipation. It gives people the ability \nto view the world with an impermanent and interdependent perspective, which leads them to a more moral and \nenlightened way of living. \n \n                          \n                              HISTORICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL CONTEXT \n \nWithin the rich field of Buddhist thought, the idea of Pratityasamutpada (Dependent Origination) has experienced \nan intriguing historical evolution. From its beginnings in early Buddhism to its various schools' interpretations, it \nunderwent evolution. This is a synopsis of its historical evolution: \n \n\uf0b7 Early Buddhism (Theravada Tradition): The teachings of Siddhartha Gautama, who subsequently became \nknown as the Buddha, are the foundation of Pratityasamutpada. It is widely mentioned in the Pali Canon, \nwhich is Theravada Buddhism's canonical literature. Pratityasamutpada is depicted in early Buddhist texts \nas a chain of twelve interconnected links that represent the cycle of suffering and rebirth, which begins \nwith ignorance and ends with old age and death. Clarifying the sources of suffering and the way to \nemancipation (nirvana) is the main goal.",

His teachings are the source of the essential components of the twelve links of \ndependent origination, and they are preserved in early Buddhist texts such as the Pali Canon. The \nfoundation of the idea is the Buddha's understanding of causality, which leads to liberation and insights \ninto the nature of suffering. \n\uf0b7 Nagarjuna: Known for his insights into Pratityasamutpada, Nagarjuna is a well-known Mahayana Buddhist \nphilosopher. He expounded on the concept of emptiness (shunyata) and illustrated its connection to \nDependent Origination in his writings, especially in works such as the \"Mulamadhyamakakarika\" \n(Fundamental Verses on the Middle Way). He maintained that comprehending emptiness is necessary in \norder to understand causality. \n\uf0b7 A significant contribution to the growth of the Yogacara school of Buddhism was made by the brothers \nAsanga and Vasubandhu. These writings, which include the \"Yogacarabhumi Shastra,\" examined the \nnature of consciousness and the mind's function in Dependent Origination processes. It is crucial to \ncomprehend how our experiences of causality are shaped by our perceptions and consciousness, they \nstressed. \n\uf0b7 Dependent Origination was further developed by Aryadeva, a Nagarjuna disciple, in his work \n\"Catuhsataka.\" He went on to offer more justifications and arguments regarding the nature of causality and \nthe interdependence of phenomena.",

These connections highlight how ignorance and desire feed the \ncycle of birth, death, and rebirth as well as the interconnectedness of causality. The twelve links and how they are \nrelated are listed below: \n \n\uf0b7 Ignorance (Avijja): The cycle starts with ignorance, which is the basic misperception of what reality is \nreally like. The lack of a stable, unchanging self and ignorance of the Four Noble Truths are examples of \nignorance. It is the main reason people suffer. \n\uf0b7 Mental Formations (Sankhara): Volitional activities or mental formations are the result of ignorance. These \nare the karmic intentions or impulses that give rise to thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Mental constructs \nare produced from the erroneous perception of reality that results from ignorance. \n\uf0b7 Vijnana (consciousness): The emergence of consciousness is caused by mental formations. This \nconsciousness is the awareness or cognition associated with a being; it is not the same as the Western \nconcept of a soul. It results from the mental formations that give rise to karmic tendencies. \n\uf0b7 Name and Form (Nama-rupa): The mental and physical aspects of existence are represented by the name \nand form that a particular individual is formed with. Consciousness is linked to this process. This link \ndemonstrates how the body and mind are interdependent. \n\uf0b7 The Salayatana (Six Senses): The six senses\u2014sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch, and thought\u2014are derived \nfrom name and form. The faculties that enable humans to perceive their surroundings are the senses. \n\uf0b7 Phase of contact (Phassa): The interplay of sensory perception with external objects occurs when the six \nsenses establish contact with the outside world. Feelings are produced by this interaction and can be neutral, \nunpleasant, or pleasant. \n\uf0b7 Feeling (Vedana): Feelings are the subjective experiences of neutrality, pain, or pleasure that arise from \ncontact. Craving and aversion are largely influenced by feelings. \n\uf0b7 Craving (Tanha): Strong desires for pleasure or an aversion to pain are the results of feelings. The source \nof the cycle of pain and rebirth is craving, which has its roots in ignorance. \n\uf0b7 Attachment (Upadana): Unchecked craving leads to attachment. This is the holding on to things, concepts, \nor experiences in the hope that they will provide long-term happiness.",

Explains how ignorance leads to misunderstanding reality, fuels the cycle of rebirth (samsara), and creates attachment to a false sense of self. Describes ignorance as one of Buddhism's \"three poisons\" and outlines how overcoming it through wisdom (prajna) is essential for achieving liberation.\nwww.ijcrt.org                                                              \u00a9 2023 IJCRT | Volume 11, Issue 10 October 2023 | ISSN: 2320-2882 \nIJCRT2310409 \nInternational Journal of Creative Research Thoughts (IJCRT) www.ijcrt.org \nd631 \n \nA central tenet of Buddhist philosophy is the idea that ignorance (avidya) is what ultimately leads to samsara and \nsuffering. It is essential to comprehending the nature of humanity and the cycle of rebirth, death, and birth \n(samsara). An examination of how ignorance serves as the main cause of suffering is provided below: \n \n\uf0b7 Misunderstanding Reality: Within the Buddhist context, ignorance is defined as a deep misapprehension \nof reality's actual nature. It is not just ignorance; rather, it is a deeply held myth that permeates human \nexistence. This ignorance includes a variety of misconceptions, such as the idea that there is an eternal self \n(atman) and the incorrect understanding of impermanence. \n\uf0b7 Avidya's Place in the Twelve Links: As the first link in the chain of dependent origination \n(Pratityasamutpada), ignorance signifies the cycle of suffering's fundamental role. The cycle begins when \nignorance gives rise to mental formations, which ultimately cause the cycle to unfold. Ignorance feeds the \ncycle by encouraging people to take careless actions that result in pain and subsequent rebirth. \n\uf0b7 Causal Ignorance: Ignorance is a causal factor as well as the initial cause of suffering. It pushes people to \ntake part in delusional and attachment-based deeds (karma), which further entangles them in the samsara \ncycle. Future incarnations will suffer as a result of these karmic deeds. \n\uf0b7 Misconception of the Self: Believing in the existence of a permanent, unchanging self (atman) is one of the \nfundamental characteristics of ignorance. This false belief causes people to identify primarily with their \nego and belongings, placing a high value on the self. This attachment to self gives rise to desires, cravings, \nand aversions that lead to persistent dissatisfaction, which makes it a major cause of suffering. \n\uf0b7 Impermanence and Interdependence: People who lack knowledge are unable to recognize the \nimpermanence and interdependence that exist. All phenomena are related to and influenced by other \nphenomena, and everything in the world is actually always changing. When attachments to things that are \ninevitably broken, ignorance causes suffering because it encourages attachment to things that are inherently \ntransient and interconnected. \n\uf0b7 The Road to Liberation: According to Buddhist doctrine, achieving enlightenment\u2014also known as \nnirvana\u2014requires eliminating ignorance. The goal of prajna, the practice of developing wisdom and \ninsight, is to eradicate ignorance. One can rise above the illusion of ignorance by realizing that everything \nis transient and interconnected and that there is no such thing as a permanent self. \n\uf0b7 Three Poisons: Along with greed (craving) and hatred (aversion), ignorance is sometimes referred to as \none of the \"three poisons\" in Buddhism. The main culprits behind suffering are these three poisons. Since \nignorance is the source of both desire and aversion, addressing and eliminating ignorance is essential to \ncuring the other two poisons. \n \nAccording to Buddhist philosophy, ignorance (avidya) is the primary cause of samsara and suffering because it \nresults in a basic misinterpretation of reality, which includes a false sense of self and a lack of awareness of",

Birth and death are caused by attachment and craving, which are both products of ignorance. \nThe way this chain links together and illustrates how each one is dependent upon the others indicates that \nreality is a causally driven, dynamic process. \n\uf0b7 Since everything is transient, causality is closely related to impermanence. The point made by \nPratityasamutpada is that nothing stays constant or unchanging. Realizing that everything is impermanent \nis essential to understanding the nature of reality because everything is always changing. \n\uf0b7 The lack of an intrinsic, unchanging self (anatta) is emphasized by Pratityasamutpada. The notion of \ncausation in this context indicates that the self is a construction that results from the interaction of multiple \nfactors. In the chain of causality, there is no stationary self. \n\uf0b7 The Madhyamaka school of Mahayana Buddhism introduces the concept of emptiness (Shunyata), which \ndeepens our understanding of causality. The absence of inherently existing things is represented by \nemptiness.

People can take steps to address \nthe root causes of their suffering and work toward breaking free from the cycle of pain and rebirth by \nbecoming aware of these causes. \n \nEssentially, Pratityasamutpada's explanation of causality shows that reality is essentially an empty, transient, and \ninterdependent web of interrelated phenomena. It questions the idea of a permanent, unchanging self and exhorts \npeople to identify the root causes of suffering and pursue emancipation via morality and wisdom.

This is an examination of how these \naspects of Buddhist practice are informed by this understanding: \n \nEthical Conduct: \n\uf0b7 Ethical Awareness: According to Pratityasamutpada, suffering stems from ignorance, or avijja. Because \nignorance breeds bad behavior and feeds the cycle of suffering, practitioners are forced to confront the \nmoral ramifications of ignorance.

Pratityasamutpada indicates the path to emancipation and offers a \nframework for comprehending the origins of suffering. The attainment of liberation and the end of suffering are \nthe results of realizing Pratityasamutpada in the following ways: \n \n\uf0b7 Acknowledgment of Ignorance as the Fundamental Cause: The first link in the chain of Pratityasamutpada \nis ignorance (avijja). The first stage in the process is realizing ignorance is the primary source of suffering. \nPeople are prompted to consider their deeply held misconceptions about who they are, reality, and existence \nin light of this awareness. \n\uf0b7 Diagram of the Cycle: Pratityasamutpada presents the twelve interconnected threads that sustain the \nsuffering cycle. Through these connections, people with wisdom and insight can determine the origins of \nsuffering and comprehend how ignorance gives rise to craving, attachment, and birth. Their comprehension \nenables them to sever the pattern and escape its hold. \n\uf0b7 Cultivation of Wisdom (Prajna): The cultivation of wisdom (prajna) is an essential prerequisite for the \nrealization of Pratityasamutpada. To break the cycle of causation and transcend ignorance, wisdom is \nessential. Understanding the interdependence of phenomena, the transience of all things, and the lack of a \npermanent self are all necessary components of wisdom. \n\uf0b7 Vipassana, or insight meditation, is a potent technique that enables people to personally experience the \nimpermanence and interconnectedness of phenomena. Practitioners watch as ideas, feelings, and sensations \ncome and go via mindfulness and introspection. The comprehension offered by Pratityasamutpada is \nstrengthened by this firsthand encounter. \n\uf0b7 Development of Ethical Behavior: Ethical behavior is informed by Pratityasamutpada's realization. \nPractitioners make an effort to act in ways that lessen suffering and foster virtues because they are aware \nof the effects of their actions in the chain of dependent origination. \n\uf0b7 Non-Attachment: Letting go of attachment and craving becomes increasingly evident as one progresses in \nrealizing Pratityasamutpada. People lose their attachment to things, wants, and the false idea of a permanent \nself as they come to understand causality. \n\uf0b7 Ceasing of Craving: Practitioners gradually lessen and ultimately do away with craving (tanha) by ceasing \nignorance and cultivating wisdom.

The practical applications \nof Pratityasamutpada's insights can be found in spiritual practices, ethical behavior, and tackling modern issues \nlike social justice, mental health, environmental ethics, and global interconnectedness. \nBut Pratityasamutpada has encountered criticism and opposition from both Buddhists and non-Buddhists. Its \nintricacy, varying interpretations, and dearth of empirical support have drawn criticism. Several Buddhist traditions \nhave responded to these criticisms by changing and refining the idea to address contemporary issues and place an \nemphasis on firsthand experience, personal liberation, or enlarged scope. These modifications show how adaptable \nand profound Buddhist thinking is when negotiating the nuances of modern existential and moral quandaries.",

This idea can provide a counterpoint to essentialist conceptions of identity in the age of neuroscience and \ncognitive science, which can be useful in the ongoing discussions concerning the nature of consciousness and the \nself.

Serves as the foundational opening to a comprehensive analysis of how beings arise in samsara and potentially achieve liberation.\nThe Special Theory of Pratityasamutpada: \nThe Cycle of Dependent Origination1 \nby Geshe Lhundub Sopa \n\"Whoever sees dependent origination \nsees the Dharma. Whoever sees the \nDharma sees the Buddha.\" (Majjhima \nNikdya, 1:28) \nThe idea of dependent origination, the seeing of which is \nsaid to be coextensive with the seeing of the Dharma itself, is \nclearly one of the most central theories in all of Buddhism. \nThere is both the general theory and a special theory. The \nformer is coextensive with the spectrum of particularly Buddhist \ntheories accounting for genesis in general. The latter refers to \na special application of the general theory to an explanation of \nthe genesis of a living sentient being in sarnsara and the means \nof that being's potential release from such a samsaric birth. It \nis to this special theory of dependent origination that the above-\ncited sutra passage refers. \nThis special theory is that of the cycle of the twelve nidanas, \nor twelve components of dependent origination. Having already \ndealt briefly with the general theory of dependent origination \nin a previous paper (JIABS Vol. 7, No. 1, p. 125 ff.), we proceed \nthen to look at the cycle of twelve components, beginning with \nignorance and ending with ageing and dying. \n/. Avidya \nThus, what is the nescience {avidya) of which it is said that \n\"because of nescience formatives {samskdra) arise\"?2 \nNescience generally means simply not knowing something \nor just a state of unknowing.

It is just as untruthful-\nness does not mean a mere absence of speaking the truth but \nrather a speaking something which is the opposite of the truth, \ni.e., lying, or just as the unfriendliness between two persons \ndoes not mean a mere absence of friendliness but rather the \nopposite of friendliness, i.e., their enmity. Thus, it is stated in \nthe Abhidharmakosa, \"Nescience is a quality which is a contrary \nto understanding, like untruthful, inamicable, etc.,\"3 Likewise, \nthe Pramarpavattika says, \". . . because it is a contrary to knowing, \nand because it is a perception under the influence of a secondary \nmental component {caitta), nescience is a wrong perceiving.\"4 \nIn \nanswering \nthe \nquestion, \n\"What \nis nescience?\", \nthe \nPratityasamutpada-vibhanga-nirdesa-sutra say s, \nNot knowing the limits of the past, and not knowing the limits \nof the future.. . not knowing actions and their matura-\ntions . . . not \nknowing \nmisery, \nand \nnot \nknowing \nits \ngenesis . . . and not knowing cause . . . and not knowing virtue \nand nonvirtue, and not knowing transgression and nontransgres-\nsion, and the to-be-cultivated and the not-to-be-cultivated \n. . . etc. . . .5 \nOn the surface, the sutra seems to be signifying a mere \nabsence of knowing the past, future, cause and effect, the four \ntruths, good and evil, etc. However, the commentaries, like \nAsariga's Abhidharmasamuccaya and Vasubandhu's Pratityasamut-\npada-vibhanga-nirdesa rightly explain the sutra's real meaning of \n\"not knowing\" as that kind of not knowing which falsely misap-\nprehends these objects. Thus, generally speaking, nescience re-\nfers to a secondary mental condition, or caitta, which because \nof its natural delusion misapprehends its own proper object. \nNescience may further be subdivided from the point of view \nof the two truths (satya dvaya) into a perverse misperception of \nconventional objects like cause and effect, etc., and a perverse \nmisperception of the ultimate reality of no-self. \nHere, the former, nescience in general, is called in the \nAbhidharmakoia a ground of enormous affliction (klesa) because \nit is a concomitant of every single afflicting mental moment6 \nand consequently it may be present to both sense perception \nand to mental consciousness.",

This passage appears within a larger discussion of the twelve components of dependent origination (pratityasamutpada), specifically examining the first component of nescience.

Here, the Abhidharmakosa says: \nIn the desire realms (kdmadhdtu), attachment should be known \nas a concomitant of all the six consciousnesses. Nescience also, \nlike attachment, should be understood to be so.7 \nMoreover, all the schools of Buddhism, both upper and \nlower, agree that the nescience which binds sentient beings to \nsarnsara and which is the root of all the other afflictions, like \nattachment, etc., is the innate grasping of \"me\" and \"mine\" or \nthe nescience which is a misperception of the reality of no-self \n(nairdtmya).

Addresses an apparent inconsistency between different Buddhist texts regarding whether nescience refers to delusion about reality or delusion about cause and effect.\n108 \nJIABSVOL.9NO. 1 \nNescience is the root of whatever misfortune there is in the world. \nDependent origination is taught to be that by the seeing of which \none brings about a reversal. \nLike this, one might go on quoting similar passages from the \nBuddhist sutras and commentaries for a very long time. \nThus, for reasons already mentioned above, that nescience \nwhich is the first of the twelve components of dependent origi-\nnation may be defined simply as a mental component which is \ndelusion as to reality and which is a prime motivator of a seeding \naction (karma). \nIn the Tibetan literature dealing with the subject, a number \nof interesting discussions arise. For example, the Abhidhar-\nmasamuccaya of Asariga states: \nDelusion (moha) is twofold: delusion as to the ripening of a result, \nand delusion as to the real. On account of delusion as to the \nripening of a result, unmeritorious actions are accumulated. On \naccount of delusion as to the real, meritorious and immutable \n(acala) actions are accumulated.12 \nThus, it is stated that unwholesome actions are impelled by \nnescience as to cause and effect. Isn't this statement then incon-\nsistent with the above definition of nescience as delusion as to \nthe real which is a motivator of a seeding action? On close \nexamination, there is actually no inconsistency here, for Asahga's \nstatement about the impulsion of unmeritorious actions by de-\nlusion as to cause and effect is made from the point of view of \nthe motivation which is synchronic with the action itself. On the \nother hand, it is from the point of view of a primary causal \nmotivation that he explains the nescience which is delusion as \nto the real, i.e., the nescience which grasps a self and which is \nthe motivator of a seeding karma. It is, moreover, just this pri-\nmary causal motivation which is the actual impeller of the action, \nwhereas the synchronic motivation is mainly the train of ideation \nwhich occurs simultaneously with the actions. This kind of \nAbhidharma discussion is often rather difficult to render into \nEnglish briefly in an easily understandable way. The import \nhere is that Asariga's two statements are from the point of view \nof two different modes of causality, and we are left with delusion",

Samskdra \nThe second component of the cycle is variously called the \nformative (samskdra) of dependent origination or formative ac-\ntion (samskdra-karma). Like nescience, a formative action is a \nmental component, or caitta. It is a thrust, or proclivity, or incli-\nnation, or impulse (cetand). Generally speaking, it is an impulse \nwhich is motivated by nescience and which projects or seeds \nthat future life which is its own proper projectory or target. It \nis threefold: a meritorious act which seeds a birth among the \nfortunate transmigrants in the desire realms (kdmadhdtu); an \nunmeritorious act which seeds a birth among the unfortunate \ntransmigrants of the desire realm; and thirdly, an acala karma, \nor act which is immutable as to its outcome and which seeds a \nbirth among the transmigrants in the two higher realms, i.e., \nthe realms of form and of no-form. \nAgain, this formative action is often explained as twofold, \ni.e., impulse action and gathering action.'s Here, it is said in \nthe Abhidharmasamuccaya, \"What is action (karma)? It is impulse \naction and gathering action, for this is the epitome of action.\"14 \nAlso, in the Abhidharmakosa, \"Impulse is a mental action, and \nfrom this there develops bodily and vocal action.\"10 Here, \nmoreover, impulse action is a mental action, whereas gathering \naction is explained as bodily and vocal action. The Vaibhasika \nand Prasarigika Madhyamika schools of Buddhist thought re-\ngard this gathering action of body and speech as corporeal. The \nSautrantika, Yogacara, and Svatantrika Madhyamika schools, \non the other hand, accept it as a mental component which occurs \ntogether with the activity of body and speech. \nIn the Sdlisambhava-sutra, the Buddha explains samskdra by \nway of analogy with causation in the external world. The ac-\ncumulation of seeding actions refers to the planting of the whole-\nsome and unwholesome seeds which project the births of sen-\ntient beings in any of the fortunate or unfortunate realms respec-\ntively by the power of the nescience (avidyd) which grasps a self. \nHere, the meaning of \"to project a birth\" is to cause whatever",

It is just as, in a struggle, \na weak person does not defeat a powerful one. Here, Nagarjuna \nsays, \"To one who sees the truth there is no sowing. To one \nwho is free of craving there is no rebirth.\"16 \nIn the life of the aryan, there is no fresh accumulation of \nseeding action, even though the potentials of previous seeding \nactions sown formerly while that being was still in the stages of \nordinary individuality are aroused from dormancy by germina-\ntive action and craving.16a From the stages of the attainment of \nthe aryan path up to the achievement of arhantship, sarnsaric \nbirth still occurs under the power of action and afflictors, for \nas is taught in the above, each and every sarnsaric birth must \nbe roused from latency by germinative action and the moisture \nof craving. \nThus, even though seeding actions have been accumulated, \nunless they are aroused from dormancy by the three\u2014craving, \nappropriation, and becoming\u2014they will not produce rebirth in \nsamsara, just as a dry seed without moisture will not produce a \nsprout. Therefore, Nagarjuna's Pratityasamutpadahr,daya says, \n\"For one who is free from craving there is no rebirth,\" for with \nthe attainment of arhantship there is the realization of nirvana \nand the eradication of rebirth in samsara. \nAgain, actions are threefold: seeding actions, germinative \nactions, and completing actions. By a seeding action, just the \nnature which may be ripened is made to emerge. By a germina-\ntive action, the actual ripening is made to occur. By a completing \naction, the life which is made to arise by seeding and germinative \nactions is furnished with its individual peculiarities of fortune \nand misfortune. On this, the Abhidharmakosa says, \"One life is \nsown by a single seeding action, but it has many completing \nactions.\"17",

The text examines the relationship between causal and effect consciousness in different Buddhist schools of thought, transitioning into a discussion of name/form (namarupa) as the fourth component.\nPRATITYASAMUTPADA \n111 \nThus, four possibilities of birth in samsara may be discussed \nwith respect to wholesome and unwholesome seeding and finish-\ning actions. First, both seeding and completing actions are \nwholesome, as in the birth of deities and the most fortunate of \nhumans. Secondly, both are unwholesome, as in the births of \nthe three unfortunate realms. Thirdly, seeding action is whole-\nsome, whereas completing actions are unwholesome, as in in-\nstances of the births of humans whose lives are impoverished, \nailing and short. Finally, seeding action is unwholesome, \nwhereas completing action is wholesome, as in the instances of \nthe births of animals who live as pets in ease and comfort under \nsomeone's loving care. \n///. Vijndna \nThe third component of the cycle of dependent origination \nis consciousness, and it is explained as twofold: as a consciousness \nat the time of the cause, or a causal consciousness, and as a \nconsciousness at the time of the effect, or an effect consciousness. \nHere, a causal consciousness refers to the prime consciousness \non which is fixed the impression deposited by a seeding action. \nWhenever either a wholesome or an unwholesome seeding ac-\ntion is done, its impression or seed has to continue on without \ninterruption from the time of the last moment of the action \nuntil the time of the ripening of the seed of that action. The \nkind of consciousness which is the depository or keeper of the \nseed is a causal consciousness. \nWhen, then, the impression or seed ripens and gives rise \nto some sort of birth later on, that first moment of consciousness \nbecoming conjoined with a life in a mother's womb is what is \nmeant by an effect consciousness. According to the Yogacarins, \nthis kind of causal and effect consciousness is dlayavijndna, or \nfoundation consciousness. In the systems of both the Vaibhasika \nand the Sautrantika, as well as in those of the Madyamika, it is \na stabler sort of mental consciousness, or manovijnana. \nIV.

Very roughly speaking, it cor-\nresponds to what in the non-Buddhist systems might be called \nbody and soul, or at least a phase of it. Buddhism, of course, \navoids such a label because it is referring specifically to a tem-\nporal or developmental phase of a multiple composite. We may \ntake the example of a human life. From the time of a conscious-\nness' first union with an embryo in the mother's womb up to \nthe time of the evolvement of the six sense organs, the five \npsycho-physical aggregates\u2014the five skandhas of Buddhism\u2014 \nare already present. Among these five, the body, consisting of \nthe mixed parental blood and semen, is designated \"form,\" \nwhereas the remaining four mental aggregates as they exist in \nthis developmental period are designated \"name\" because they \nform a basis or referent for naming. \nAll the schools of Buddhism accept that in the realms of \ndesire and of form there is both name and form. However, \nsome of these schools accept that corporeity is entirely absent \nin the realm of no-form (arupyadhdtu), and for these there exists \nonly name, or the four noncorporeal aggregates in the formless \nrealm. On the other hand, the others accept that whereas there \nis no gross body in the formless realm, there is nonetheless an \nextremely subtle corporeity. For these, both the name and form \nare present even in the formless realm. Such differences not-\nwithstanding, for the Buddhist schools the principal basis or \nprimary referent which is being designated by names like \"sen-\ntient being,\" \"life,\" \"person,\" \"personality,\" etc., are the four \nmental aggregates and not form or body. \nV. \u00a7o4dyatana \nThe six sense organs (sa4ayatana) of the cycle of dependent \norigination is the fifth component.

Buddhism distinguishes four \nmodes of birth: from a womb (like humans); from an egg (like \nbirds); from warmth and moisture (like certain insects); and by \na miraculous birth (like gods). In instances of the three former \nkinds of birth, the sense organs are said to develop in stages. \nIn instances of divine birth as well as birth in the intermediate \nstate {antarabhava, bardo), it is said that there is no gradual evolve-\nment of the sense organs but that they occur wholely and all at \nonce.

This contact de-\npends on the meeting or drawing together of the three, an outer \nobject of cognition, an inner sense organ, and a moment of \nconsciousness or cognition.

Vedana \nFeeling {vedana) is the seventh component of the cycle of \ndependent origination. This feeling is the appearance of any \npleasant, disagreeable, or indifferent feeling consistent with the \nrealization by contact of the threefold fluctuation of the object \nfield. This is simply to say that on encountering an attractive \nobject there arises a pleasant feeling; on encountering an unat-\ntractive object there is a disagreeable feeling; and on encounter-\ning a neutral object the feeling is one of indifference.

From the point of \nview of the cause of seeding action, there is a threefold series \nof causes consisting of nescience, formatives, and consciousness. \nFrom the point of view of the effect or the result sown, there \nis the fourfold series consisting of name and form, the six sense \norgans, contact, and feeling. \nIn the Sdlisambhava-sutra,lH these are explained on the anal-\nogy of the production of a crop. Thus nescience is comparable \nto the farmer who sows a field, formatives or formative action \nto the field itself, and consciousness to the seed sown, from \nwhich arises the sprout of name and form. Similarly, from the \npoint of view of the causes which are the sower of a birth, \nnescience is the sower because it is the prime mover of an action. \nThen, just as from the field various good and bad crops are \nproduced, from action also there is a production of various good \nand bad maturation results, and so these actions are like the \nfield, and consciousness, because it contains the potential to \nproduce the fruit of action, is like the seed.

Critiques a recent study by Yu et al. (2020) that conflates these two distinct concepts. Sets up the paper's analysis by examining how Yu et al. misinterpret an early Buddhist text about specific conditionality as supporting the later concept of universal interdependence.\nORIGINAL PAPER\nDependent Arising and Interdependence\nBhikkhu An\u0101layo1\nAccepted: 27 October 2020\n# \u00a9The Author(s) 2020, corrected publication 2021\nAbstract\nThe Buddhist teaching on dependent arising (or dependent origination) concerns specific conditions whose presence is indis-\npensable for something to come into existence. In the early stages of Buddhist history, the overarching concern of this doctrine\nwas to identify the specific causes responsible for the human predicament, with a view to bringing about their cessation so as to\nbecome liberated. In later times, Buddhist exegesis developed various perspectives on causality, where in Huayan philosophy in\nparticular the notion of interconnectedness or interdependence arose, according to which all phenomena relate to each other in\none way or another. Despite its traction in the contemporary setting, this notion needs to be recognized as a later development that\nis by no means identical with the basic Buddhist teaching on dependent arising.\nKeywords Conditionality .

Specific conditionality\nProgress in the understanding of mindfulness in its various\napplications can benefit greatly from a collaboration between\nthose active in the academic fields of psychology and\nBuddhist studies. A particularly intriguing aspect in this\nrespect is an exploration of the doctrinal underpinnings of\nBuddhist mindfulness practices. A recent investigation along\nthese lines by Yu et al. (2020) took up in particular the\nBuddhist doctrine of causality, which is indeed of consider-\nable relevance to mindfulness practices. A problem with this\nin itself laudable endeavor is an apparent conflation of per-\nspectives on this doctrine that arose at quite different times in\nthe history of Buddhism. This can best be exemplified with\nthe following extract from Yu et al. (p. 1239):\nInterconnectedness is a central tenet underlying all\nBuddhist teachings. It is expressed in Buddhism as\n\u201cWhen there is this, that comes to be; with the arising\nof this, that arises. When there is not this, that does not\ncome to be; with the cessation of this, that ceases\u201d\n(\u00d1\u0101\u1e47amoli and Bodhi 1995, p. 655). It delineates the\ninterdependent nature of all phenomena in the world,\nimplying that the arising of all matters is conditioned\non the arising of one another. In other words, all matters\nare mutually influencing one another and co-arising de-\npendently \u2026\nTake the growth of an apple tree as an example, simply\nhaving a seed cannot bear fruit to an apple tree [sic]. It\nmust have the right conditions of suitable climate, ade-\nquate sunshine, moisture, and nutrients from the soil in\norder to grow and bear fruit. Any condition missing or\nnot in the appropriate amount may lead to a different\noutcome. Interconnectedness can be operationally de-\nfined as an awareness that the existence of all phenom-\nena in the world is the result of the fulfillment of differ-\nent causes and conditions, in which no entity can sustain\nindependently without relying on other factors. The in-\nsight of interconnectedness, originating from the con-\ncept of dependent origination, lays the foundation of\nother Buddhist teachings in understanding the causes\nof suffering and ways to eradicate suffering.\nThe quotation given by the authors (\u201cWhen there is this\n\u2026\u201d) leads to the translation of the C\u016b\u1e37asakulud\u0101yi-sutta",

Examines how the Buddha emphasized discussing present conditions rather than past lives, using examples like an apple tree to illustrate specific causality versus universal interdependence. Analyzes how this misunderstanding affects research methodology and interpretation of Buddhist concepts like dukkha and the eightfold path.\nreally fruitful when discussing with someone who had the\nhigher knowledges of recollection of past lives and of the\ndivine eye (which was not the case for the leader of the wan-\nderers). Instead of taking up what belongs to the past or the\nfuture, the Buddha recommended they rather discuss what\npertains to the present. As a way of turning to what is present\n(and implicitly what does not require any specialized knowl-\nedge such as recollection of past lives or the divine eye),\naccording to the P\u0101li discourse he presented the standard for-\nmulation of specific conditionality, as per the quote above. A\nparallel to the C\u016b\u1e37asakulud\u0101yi-sutta in the Madhyama-\u0101gama\n(M\u0100 208), however, does not have a reference to this standard\nformulation (An\u0101layo 2011).\nThe reference given by Yu et al. (2020) to the translation of\nthe C\u016b\u1e37asakulud\u0101yi-sutta relates their presentation to the early\nBuddhist teaching on causality in the form of specific condi-\ntions. This idea finds exemplification in the example of the\ngrowth of an apple tree, which requires a set of specific con-\nditions, such as the seed, moisture, etc. The same idea is also at\nthe background of \u201cBuddhist teachings in understanding the\ncauses of suffering and ways to eradicate suffering.\u201d\nOther parts of the above quote, however, reflect the notion\nof interconnectedness or interdependence, the idea that every-\nthing depends on everything else. This idea stands behind the\nnotion that \u201cthe arising of all matters is conditioned on the\narising of one another\u201d and \u201call matters are mutually influenc-\ning one another and co-arising dependently.\u201d Contrary to the\nimpression created by the authors, such notions are quite dif-\nferent from what the quote from the C\u016b\u1e37asakulud\u0101yi-sutta\nrefers to and also from what the example of the apple tree\nillustrates. The growth of the apple tree does not dependent\non \u201call matters\u201d; it only requires a set of specific conditions.\nTake the computer used to write this article. Although indis-\npensable for such writing, it is of no relevance to the growth of\nan apple tree.\nThe same basic principle holds for the Buddhist teaching\non understanding dukkha, often but somewhat misleadingly\ntranslated as \u201csuffering.\u201d This depends on specific conditions.\nThe possibility of eradicating dukkha, envisaged in Buddhist\nthought, has its foundation in identifying specific conditions\nresponsible for the arising of dukkha rather than in an insight\ninto interconnectedness. The idea is that, once a specific con-\ndition like ignorance has been identified, it becomes possible\nto cultivate a path aimed at its eradication and therewith the\neradication of dukkha.\nThe notion of \u201cinterconnectedness\u201d or \u201cinterdependence,\u201d\nin contrast to specific conditionality, reflects a mature stage in\nthe evolution of Mah\u0101y\u0101na thought, arisen in particular in rela-\ntion to teachings in the Buddhavata\u1e43saka.

(p. 1240) that\n\u201cin Buddhism, conceptually, mindfulness and recognition of\ninterconnectedness are part of the eightfold paths [sic]\u201d is\nunfortunately wrong. Only mindfulness is part of the eightfold\npath, being its seventh factor.\nAs a foundation for proper research, it is important that the\noperationalized concepts are clearly defined and that a confla-\ntion between divergent ideas is avoided.

Here is the standard formulation of such specific\nconditionality, using as example a P\u0101li discourse whose pre-\nsentation has a parallel in its Chinese \u0100gama counterpart:\nThis being, that exists; with the arising of this, that\narises. This not being, that does not exist; with the ceas-\ning of this, that ceases.\n(SN 12.21: iti imasmi\u1e43sati ida\u1e43hoti, imass\u2019 upp\u0101d\u0101\nida\u1e43uppajjati. imasmi\u1e43asati ida\u1e43na hoti, imassa\nnirodh\u0101 ida\u1e43nirujjhati).\nIn dependence on this, that exists; with the arising of\nthis, that arises \u2026 with the ceasing of this, that ceases;\nthis not being, that does not exist.\n(E\u0100 46.3: \u56e0\u662f\u6709\u662f, \u6b64\u751f\u5247\u751f\u2026 \u6b64\u6ec5\u5247\u6ec5, \u6b64\u7121\u5247\u7121).\nThis type of presentation often leads over to an exposition\nof the conditioned arising and ceasing of 12 links, to be taken\nup in more detail below. As paraphrased by Jones (2011, p.\n17), the implications of the above basic statement are that what\n\u201cexists has come into being dependent on particular causes\nand conditions; and when those causes and conditions cease,\nthe things that depend on them will also cease.\u201d This is not an\naffirmation that everything is interconnected with everything\nelse. Instead, it is a statement of specific conditionality.\nOlendzki (2010, p. 110) commented that this formula \u201ccan\nbe applied to almost any field of inquiry including natural\nsystems, social interactions, political dynamics, and historical\nevents. The matter of most immediate concern for the Buddha,\nhowever, was the field of human experiential phenomenolo-\ngy.\u201d The notion that specific conditionality can have such a\ngeneral range of applicability, however, has been challenged\nby Shulman (2008, p. 299), proposing that\nMindfulness  (2021) 12:1094\u20131102\n1095",

        "page_content": "Focuses on examining and refuting Shulman's argument that Buddhist dependent arising applies only to mental phenomena. Addresses a key debate about whether dependent arising describes reality in general or is limited to mental conditioning. Presents textual evidence from early Buddhist discourses showing that dependent arising was applied beyond just mental phenomena, including to material things like houses.\ndependent-origination addresses the workings of the\nmind alone \u2026 Viewing prat\u012btya-samutp\u0101da [dependent\norigination] as a description of the nature of reality in\ngeneral means investing the words of the earlier teach-\nings with meanings derived from later Buddhist dis-\ncourse. This results in a misrepresentation of much of\nwhat early Buddhism was about.\nShulman (2008, p. 307) supported his position with the\nfollowing argument, based on the P\u0101li discourses:\nWhen the Buddha says \u201cWhen this is, that is, etc.,\u201d he is\nspeaking only of mental conditioning, and is saying ab-\nsolutely nothing about existence per se. The most sig-\nnificant evidence for this fact is that the phrase\n\u201cimasmi\u1e43sati ida\u1e43hoti \u2026\u201d never occurs detached\nfrom the articulation of the 12 links, save one\noccurrence.\nThe one occurrence referred to by him is the\nC\u016b\u1e37asakulud\u0101yi-sutta (MN 79), already mentioned above,\nwhere the formula supposedly \u201cinvolves a discussion regard-\ning recollection of past lives, an issue closely related to what\nthe 12 links are about.\u201d A minor objection that could be made\nhere is that the occurrence in the C\u016b\u1e37asakulud\u0101yi-sutta does\nnot really involve \u201ca discussion regarding past lives,\u201d as the\ndiscourse much rather reports the Buddha setting aside the\ntopic of past lives and instead propounding the principle of\nspecific conditionality. A more significant objection would be\nthat the same principle does occur in another P\u0101li discourse\nwithout leading on to the whole set of 12 links (SN 12.62).\nThe discourse in question depicts a noble disciple who prop-\nerly pays penetrative attention to dependent arising\n(pa\u1e6diccasamupp\u0101da\u1e43yeva s\u0101dhuka\u1e43yoniso manasi karoti).\nThis takes the form of the basic principle of specific condi-\ntionality (imasmi\u1e43sati \u2026). The ensuing exemplification of\nthis principle then turns to the relationship between contact\n(phassa) and feeling tone (vedan\u0101), which are only 2 out of the\n12 links, without mentioning the other links. This would count\nas an instance of a P\u0101li discourse where the basic statement of\nspecific conditionality does not lead over to the full set of 12\nlinks, which are only found in the preceding discourse (SN\n12.61).\nThe idea that dependent arising is confined to matters of the\nmind also does not seem to reflect the position of the early\ndiscourses accurately. An example in case would be the fol-\nlowing description from the Mah\u0101hatthipadopama-sutta and\nits Madhyama-\u0101gama parallel:\nSpace that is enclosed in reliance on timber, in reliance\non vine, in reliance on grass, and in reliance on clay\ncomes to be reckoned a \u201chouse.\u201d\n(MN 28: ka\u1e6d\u1e6dha\u00f1 ca pa\u1e6dicca valli\u00f1 ca pa\u1e6dicca ti\u1e47a\u00f1 ca\npa\u1e6dicca mattika\u00f1 ca pa\u1e6dicca \u0101k\u0101so pariv\u0101rito ag\u0101ra\u1e43\ntveva sa\u1e45kha\u1e43gacchati).\nSpace that is enclosed in reliance on timber, in reliance\non clay, and in reliance on water and grass gives in turn\nrise to the appellation \u201ca house.\u201d\n(M\u0100 30: \u56e0\u6750\u6728, \u56e0\u6ce5\u571f, \u56e0\u6c34\u8349, \u8986\u88f9\u65bc\u7a7a, \u4fbf\u751f\u5c4b\u540d).\nNote that both versions explicitly refer to \u201cdependence\u201d\n(pa\u1e6dicca/\u56e0), here rendered as \u201creliance\u201d to fit the context.\nThis does seem to be a case of listing specific conditions for\nthe construction of a house (in the manner this was usually\ndone in ancient India). Moreover, the context is a discussion of\nthe first aggregate of bodily form, which concerns the material\ndimension of subjective experience. Unless one were to take\nan idealist position, such an application of specific condition-\nality could not be reckoned to concern just the workings of the\nmind or mental conditioning.",

Paying wise attention, a break-\nthrough as it really is arose for me: With birth not being,\nold age and death do not come to be; with the ceasing of\nbirth, old age and death cease.\n(Trip\u0101\u1e6dh\u012b 1962, p. 92: tasya mamaitad abhavat: kasmin\nnv asati jar\u0101mara\u1e47a\u1e43na bhavati, kasya nirodh\u0101j\njar\u0101mara\u1e47anirodha\u1e25? tasya mama yoni\u015bo manasi\nkurvata eva\u1e43yath\u0101bh\u016btasy\u0101bhisamaya udap\u0101di:\nj\u0101ty\u0101m asaty\u0101m jar\u0101mara\u1e47a\u1e43na bhavati, j\u0101tinirodh\u0101j\njar\u0101mara\u1e47anirodha\u1e25).\nThen I had in turn this thought: Because of the non-\nexistence of what state does this old age, disease, and\ndeath not exist? Because of the ceasing of what state do\nold age, disease, and death cease? Then, paying right\nattention, a breakthrough as it really is arose: There\nbeing no birth, there is then no old age, disease, and\ndeath; because of birth ceasing, old age, disease, and\ndeath then cease.\n(S\u0100 285: \u6211\u6642\u5fa9\u4f5c\u662f\u5ff5: \u4f55\u6cd5\u7121\u6545\u7121\u6b64\u8001, \u75c5, \u6b7b? \u4f55\u6cd5\u6ec5\n\u6545\u8001, \u75c5, \u6b7b\u6ec5? \u5373\u6b63\u601d\u60df, \u8d77\u5982\u5be6\u7121\u9593\u7b49: \u7121\u751f\u5247\u7121\u8001, \u75c5,\n\u6b7b; \u751f\u6ec5\u6545, \u5247\u8001, \u75c5, \u6b7b\u6ec5).\nThe fact that old age and death are to be expected for one\nwho has been born may at first sight not seem to warrant the\nqualification of being a penetrative understanding. However,\nthis qualification applies similarly to each ensuing step in the\nentire investigation, which will eventually lead up to igno-\nrance as the condition whose cessation leads, via the cessation\nof the other intervening links, to transcending old age and\ndeath.

Explores how these links relate to and reinterpret Vedic creation myths in early Buddhist discourse. Transitions into discussing how this principle of specific conditionality applies to mindfulness practices, particularly in relation to sense experiences.\nAlthough there is an overall pattern in this series of 12\nlinks, with the preceding link forming a condition for the\nensuing one, the underlying conception is not confined to a\nlinear sequence in time (An\u0101layo 2019b, 2020b, c). \u201cName\u201d in\nname-and-form comprises factors like contact and feeling\ntone, which recur later on in the series. Moreover, several\ndiscourses present a reciprocal conditioning between con-\nsciousness and name-and-form. This is an important dimen-\nsion of the teaching on dependent arising, as it serves to ex-\nplain the continuity of subjective experience during life and\nfrom one life to another in the absence of a permanent entity or\nself (An\u0101layo 2018). Thus, the notion of causality standing in\nthe background of the above list of 12 links is invested with a\nconsiderable degree of complexity.\nAnother intriguing aspect is that the first part of the above list\nappears to stand in dialogue with a Vedic creation myth\ndepicting the genesis of the world (Jurewicz 2000).\nAccording to Jones (2009, p. 253), \u201cin parodying Vedic cos-\nmogony in the twelve nid\u0101nas [links], the Buddha might have\nbeen giving expression to his own teaching of dukkha and its\nending in terms that would have had startling significance to his\nhearers.\u201d Such a procedure would be well in line with a general\npattern in the early discourses, which tend to adopt and deci-\nsively re-interpret Brahminical notions apparently prevalent in\nancient India. The decisive re-interpretation in the present case\nwould be that, rather than celebrating the creation of the world,\nthe series culminates in the human predicament of being subject\nto old age and death. The cessation mode of the same teaching\nthen shows how this whole creation can be undone.\nReliance on a notion presumably fairly well known in the\nancient setting in order to create an initial impression of famil-\niarity would explain why the application of dependent arising\nby way of 12 links occurs so frequently in the early discourses,\nnamely because of its probable appeal to the ancient Indian\naudience. At the same time, however, the early discourses\nshow various alternative applications of the same basic prin-\nciple that do not involve the whole set of 12. In fact, even just\nthe conditional dependence of old age and death on birth,\ndiscussed above, is already in itself a statement of dependent\narising (and, perhaps even more importantly, of the possibility\nof dependent ceasing).\nMindfulness of Sense Experience\nThe basic principle of specific conditionality can also inform\nexercises described in the Satipa\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na-sutta for the purpose\nof cultivating mindfulness. An example is contemplation of\nthe sense spheres, found in the Satipa\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na-sutta and its\nMadhyama-\u0101gama parallel (though absent from a third paral-\nlel in the Ekottarika-\u0101gama). The relevant instructions pro-\nceed in this way for the first sense sphere of the eye and visible\nforms:\nOne knows the eye, one knows visible forms, and one\nknows the fetter that arises dependent on both; and one\nknows how an unarisen fetter arises, one knows how an\narisen fetter is removed, and one knows how a removed\nfetter does not arise in the future.\n(MN 10: cakkhu\u00f1 ca paj\u0101n\u0101ti, r\u016bpe ca paj\u0101n\u0101ti, ya\u00f1 ca\ntad ubhaya\u1e43pa\u1e6dicca uppajjati sa\u1e43yojana\u1e43ta\u00f1 ca\npaj\u0101n\u0101ti, yath\u0101 ca anuppannassa sa\u1e43yojanassa\nupp\u0101do hoti ta\u00f1 ca paj\u0101n\u0101ti, yath\u0101 ca uppannassa\nsa\u1e43yojanassa pah\u0101na\u1e43hoti ta\u00f1 ca paj\u0101n\u0101ti, yath\u0101 ca\npah\u012bnassa sa\u1e43yojanassa \u0101yati\u1e43anupp\u0101do hoti ta\u00f1 ca\npaj\u0101n\u0101ti).",

Examines instructions from early Buddhist texts about contemplating the sense spheres and understanding how mental fetters arise in dependence on sense experience. Explains the distinction between sense organs themselves and the mental capacity for sensory experience, clarifying that it is not the organs but rather lustful desire that creates bondage.\nIn dependence on the eye and visible forms, a fetter\narises internally. Actually having a fetter internally, a\nmonastic knows, as it really is, that there is a fetter in-\nternally; actually not having a fetter internally, one\nknows, as it really is, that there is no fetter internally.\nOne thus knows, as it really is, how an unarisen fetter\narises internally; and thus knows, as it really is, how an\ninternally arisen fetter ceases and does not arise again.\n(M\u0100 98: \u773c\u7de3\u8272\u751f\u5167\u7d50. \u6bd4\u4e18\u8005\u5167\u5be6\u6709\u7d50, \u77e5\u5167\u6709\u7d50\u5982\u771f,\n\u5167\u5be6\u7121\u7d50, \u77e5\u5167\u7121\u7d50\u5982\u771f. \u82e5\u672a\u751f\u5167\u7d50\u800c\u751f\u8005, \u77e5\u5982\u771f, \u82e5\u5df2\n\u751f\u5167\u7d50\u6ec5\u4e0d\u5fa9\u751f\u8005, \u77e5\u5982\u771f).\nThe same instructions apply to the other sense spheres,\nwhich are the ear and sounds, the nose and odors, the tongue\nand flavors, the body and tangibles, and the mind and mental\nobjects. The reference to the respective senses here intends the\nability to see, hear, etc., and not just the physical organ. This\nfinds exemplification in the adoption of different P\u0101li and\nSanskrit terminology. In the case of the eye, for example,\nthe sense is cakkhu/cak\u1e63u, but the organ is akkhi/ak\u1e63i. The\nterm to refer to the sense of hearing is sota/\u015brota, whereas\nthe physical organ of the ear is rather referred to as ka\u1e47\u1e47a/\nkar\u1e47a. Again, the ability to smell is called gh\u0101na/ghr\u0101\u1e47a, but\nthe term for the nose is rather n\u0101s\u0101/n\u0101s\u0101.\nSuch ability to see, hear, etc., forms a specific condition for\nthe respective sense experience, since without such ability one\nwill be unable to see, hear, etc. This does not mean that the\nfettering force of experience resides in the existence of the\nsense organ. If this were the case, it would be impossible to\nstep out of being subject to mental fetters as long as one is still\nendowed with the respective sense organ. Another discourse,\nnotably an explanation given by a lay disciple to monastics,\npresents the matter in the following way:\nThe eye is not a fetter for visible forms nor are visible\nforms a fetter for the eye, but the lustful desire that arises\nthere in dependence on both, that is the fetter there.\n(SN 41.1: na cakkhu r\u016bp\u0101na\u1e43sa\u1e43yojana\u1e43, na r\u016bp\u0101\ncakkhussa sa\u1e43yojana\u1e43; ya\u00f1 ca tattha tad ubhaya\u1e43\npa\u1e6dicca uppajjati chandar\u0101go ta\u1e43tattha sa\u1e43yojana\u1e43).\nMindfulness  (2021) 12:1094\u20131102\n1098",

Contrasts this with later Buddhist developments, particularly in the Huayan school, which shifted toward seeing all phenomena as interconnected. Demonstrates how early Buddhism emphasized specific causal conditions rather than universal interdependence.\nThe eye is not a fetter for visible forms nor are visible\nforms a fetter for the eye \u2026 but whatever lustful desire\nexists between them, that is accordingly the fetter there.\n(S\u0100 572: \u975e\u773c\u7e6b\u8272, \u975e\u8272\u7e6b\u773c\u2026 \u7136\u4e2d\u9593\u6709\u6b32\u8caa\u8005, \u96a8\u5f7c\u7e6b\n\u4e5f).\nThe two parallels agree in applying this description to the\nother senses, illustrating the situation with the example of two\noxen that are bound together by a yoke. Neither of the two\noxen is the fetter of the other. Instead, it is the yoke by which\nthey are bound together that constitutes the fetter. From this\nperspective, then, the specific conditions required for visual\nexperience, for example, to result in the state of being fettered\nare: the ability to see, the presence of something visible, and\nthe existence within the mind of a tendency to lustful desires.\nIdentifying such specific conditions is not about some form\nof interconnectedness or interdependence. Visual experience,\nto stay with this example, does not require the next sense door\nof the ear or its corresponding objects of sounds. Even the deaf\ncan still see, and vision is still possible in total silence.\nConversely, hearing is still possible for someone in total dark-\nness, and thus deprived of visual objects, or for someone\nblind, and thus lacking the ability to see. Neither seeing nor\nhearing requires the other sense organ or object in order to\nfunction.\nIn terms of the simile of the two oxen bound together by a\nyoke, their predicament does not stand in a specific causal\nrelationship to any other animal that may be grazing in the\nsame area or to birds that may be singing on a tree nearby.\nThis holds even though the presence of all these animals in the\nsame place would certainly suffice to consider them as closely\ninterconnected. Yet, whether there are other grazing animals\nor not, whether there are singing birds or not, the specific\ncondition for each oxen\u2019s state of bondage is the yoke that\nbinds it to the other oxen.\nLater Notions of Causality\nIn later times, exegetical traditions tended to develop their\nown distinct notions of general principles of conditionality.\nSurveying the development in the Therav\u0101da tradition,\nRonkin (2005, p. 232) reasoned:\nIn contradistinction to the earliest stratum of Buddhist\nthought, the Abhidhamma analysis of causal condition-\ning is primarily intended to account for the true nature of\nthe dependently co-arisen dhammas, and only second-\narily for the principle of dependent co-arising itself \u2026\nthe doctrinal shift \u2026 consists in a transition from a\nprocess-oriented to an event-oriented conception of sen-\ntient experience.\nCox (1993, p. 134) explained that, with the evolution\nof Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da exegesis, \u201cabstract causal relations are\nbeginning to be considered for their own sake, and not\nmerely as part of a discussion of dependent origina-\ntion.\u201d Eventually, \u201cwith the emergence of an indepen-\ndent and abstract causal theory, dependent origination\n\u2026 received its own particularized role, as an explana-\ntion of the process of rebirth, completely divorced from\ngeneral causal theory\u201d (p. 136).\nIt is as part of the onset of such later developments that in\nHuayan (\u83ef\u56b4) thought in particular the notion of interconnec-\ntedness or interdependence came into its own. Poceski (2004,\np. 346) explained:\nHuayan\u2019s system of religious philosophy and practice\nis a vast conglomeration of abstruse doctrines \u2026 at\nits core is a holistic vision of the universe as a dy-\nnamic web of causal interrelationships, in which each",

The\nHuayan depiction of reality is an ingenious\nreworking of the central Buddhist doctrine of\nprat\u012btyasamutp\u0101da (dependent origination) \u2026 it pos-\ntulates that each phenomenon is determined by the\ntotality of all phenomena of which it is a part, while\nthe totality is determined by each of the phenomena\nthat comprise it.

Examines how the concept shifted from early Buddhism's focus on causality to a more universal interconnectedness in modern thought, particularly influenced by Romantic-Transcendentalist thinking. Critically analyzes the practical challenges of applying interdependence theory to environmental and social justice concerns, including racism and ecological ethics.\nFar from a chain of causes and effects binding beings to\nrebirth in a world of suffering, today\u2019s interdependence\nimplies a sacred matrix of mutual communality and co-\nparticipation, the extended body of all beings. And,\nmost significant here, this shift in meaning and valuation\ndeveloped not only out of the Mahayana tradition\u2019s re-\nthinking of Buddhahood and the infusion of East Asian\nsensibilities into Buddhism but also out of some of the\nfundamental dynamics of modernity \u2026 The contempo-\nrary Buddhist ethic of interdependence \u2026 likely worked\nits way into contemporary Buddhist thought through\nremnants of the Romantic-Transcendentalist line of\nthinking that resonated with similar ideas in Huayen\n[sic] and Zen thought.\nThe promotion of notions of interconnectedness or interde-\npendence are evident, for example, in Buddhist environmen-\ntalism (An\u0101layo 2019a). Yet, as explained by Sucitto (2019, p.\n249), in this \u201cshift from the perspective of the early suttas, this\nstate of interconnection is to be encouraged, rather than con-\nstituting a description of what one needs to be released from.\u201d\nThis thus involves \u201ca distinct change of meaning from that of\nthe [early] Buddhist tradition.\u201d Besides, it is also not clear how\nthe notion that everything is interrelated could provide a co-\nherent basis for an ecological concern. Already Harris (1995,\np. 177) pointed out that\nthe intention here is to show that since all things are\ninter-related we should act in a spirit of reverence to-\nwards them all. However, the category of \u201call things\u201d\nincludes insecticides, totalitarian regimes and nuclear\nweapons and the argument therefore possesses some\nrather obvious problems. In short, it suffers from a cer-\ntain vacuity from the moral perspective.\nAs noted by Ives (2013, p. 563), for environmental con-\ncerns it is crucial to avoid undermining \u201cthe ability to make\nthe sort of distinctions that are necessary and unavoidable in\nenvironmental ethics, such as the distinction between a nega-\ntive \u2018is\u2019 (such as a toxic river) and a positive \u2018ought\u2019 (the clean\nriver that can result from clean-up efforts).\u201d From this per-\nspective, is not easy to understand how the notion of intercon-\nnectedness or interdependence could provide a coherent\ngrounding for the ability to make such distinctions, be it in\nrelation to environmental problems or other matters related to\nsocial justice.\nTake the dire need of confronting racism (An\u0101layo\n2020a), just to provide another example. Mindfulness can\nserve as a powerful way to counter racism (Magee 2019),\nand one of its modalities can be found in directing aware-\nness to our common humanity. Note that this relies on\nsomething specific, namely the basic similarity between\nall human beings, independent of their individual\nbackgrounds. It carries force because it directs mindfulness\nto something shared with other human beings but not\nshared with all material things in general, such as with cars,\ncomputers, etc. Once interconnectedness or interdepen-\ndence is brought in, however, the specific notion of com-\nmon humanity becomes submerged under a general inter-\nrelation of everything with everything else. It thereby loses\nmuch of its force.\nNevertheless, as evident in the findings by Yu et al.\n(2020, p, 1249), \u201cpeople who have higher levels of inter-\nconnectedness tend \u2026 to be more willing to endorse so-\ncial justice ideologies;\u201d in fact, \u201cevidence showed that the\nmost significant additional value of interconnectedness",

Outlines the author's methodology of analyzing the twelve links of pratityasamutpada by comparing them to Vedic equivalents. Establishes the scope and limitations of the analysis, acknowledging that while there are similarities between Buddhist and Vedic concepts, they have fundamentally different purposes and meanings.\nPlaying with Fire: The pratityasamutpada \nfrom the Perspective of Vedic Thought \nThe present paper is an attempt to look at the law of dependent \norigination (pratityasamutpdda) from the perspective of earlier Vedic \nthought, rather than that of the Buddhist texts and tradition. This \nperspective reveals several striking similarities between the Buddha\u2019s \nchain and the Vedic ideas of creation. \nThese similarities are reflected in the general structure of both \nprocesses and, in many instances, in particular notions denoting their \nstages. I am, nevertheless, well aware that in their specific contexts the \nVedic creation and the Buddha\u2019s pratityasamutpdda displayed a whole \ngamut of distinct meanings. I am also aware of the fundamental differ- \nence between these two processes: the former (the process of the \ncreation of the world) is regarded as desirable; the latter, which leads to \nsuffering, is not. \nIn my analysis I shall work with the classical formulation of the \npratityasamutpdda, consisting of twelve links. I am aware of the exis-\u2014 \ntence of different formulations in the Pali Canon,! but taking all of them \ninto consideration goes beyond the scope of this paper and needs a \ncloser collaboration between Vedic and Buddhist scholars. \nI am going to show the most important Vedic equivalents of each \nlink and the main lines along which the Buddha\u2019s reasoning may have \ngone. Since I am not a Buddhologist, I do not attempt to analyze here all \nthe meanings which have been ascribed to these links in Buddhism; I \nrestrict myself to their principal and most general meanings. \nI would also like to stress that I am aware that the interpretation of \nthe pratityasamutpdda as a polemic against the Vedic cosmogony \ntackles only one aspect of this huge problem; as the Buddha said to \nAnanda: \u201cThis conditioned origination is profound and it appears pro- \nlSee Mejor 1994, pp. 136-49.",

The investigation of all the other questions connected with the \nunderstanding of the Buddha\u2019s chain remains within the scope of \nBuddhology. \nGeneralities \nOn the most general level, the Vedic cosmogony and the pratitya- \nsamutpada describe the creation of the conditions for subject-object \ncognition, the process of this cognition, and its nature, which, in both \ndescriptions, is represented by the image of fire. \nInspired by Prof. Richard Gombrich\u2019s investigation,* I am inclined \nto believe that this similarity is neither accidental, nor caused by the \nBuddha\u2019s inability to free himself from the mental paradigms of his \nculture. I would rather argue that he formulated the pratityasamutpada \nas a polemic against Vedic thought.> Through the identification of the \ncreative process with the process that leads only to suffering, he rejected \nthe Brahmanic way of thinking in a truly spectacular way. \nIn Vedic cosmogony, the cognitive process is undertaken by the \nself-cognizing Absolute. The reflexive character of this process is \nexpressed by the word dtman, which denotes both the Absolute itself, \nthe conveyor of the cosmogonic process, and the forms assumed by the \nAbsolute in this process: the world, the human being, the inner Self, \nand finally the fire altar, which expresses those manifestations on the \nritual level. The negation of the Gtman\u2019s existence postulated in the \nBuddha\u2019s doctrine of anattd leads to the conclusion that the whole \nVedic cosmogony is based on a false assumption and its acceptance \ninevitably leads only to suffering. \n2D II 55, Gombrich\u2019s translation (in Gombrich 1996, p. 46). \n3See Reat 1990, p. 328. \n4Gombrich 1996; Gombrich 1992, pp. 159-78. \nThis may have been done not by the Buddha personally, but by the authors \nwho composed the Pali Canon. In such a case, they would be the ones who \ndisputed with the Veda. Who disputed is less important here than the fact that \nthere was such a dispute. \ner \n\u201c9 Ree \nZa \nPlaying with Fire \n79 \nThe character of the similarities between the Vedic creation and the \npratityasamutpada enables us to propose a tentative reconstruction of \nthe line of the Buddha\u2019s argument, which consisted in the redefinition \nof Brahmanic notions and ideas.\u00a9 Although the Buddha rejected the \nexistence of the dtman, he did not reject the Gtman\u2019s transformations, \nbut in formulating his pratityasamutpdda he restricted their meaning so \nas to make them denote the process of human entanglement in empirical \nexistence. This process is deprived of any absolute grounds that could \nserve as its justification, so the best thing that can be done is to stop it as \nsoon as possible. \nA general example could be provided by the famous declaration of \nthe Buddha that in this \u201cfathom-long body\u201d (vyamamatte kalevare) is \nthe world, its origin, its cessation, and the path which leads to its \ncessation.\u2019 The Sanskrit term vydmamdtra appears in SB 1.2.5.14 \ndenoting the measure of the altar. It has the shape of a man and is not \nonly the counterpart of the sacrificer but also the manifested counterpart \nof the Creator (Prajapati), and his body is understood as being identical \nwith the cosmos within which all the cosmogonic changes take place. If , \nwe deny the existence of the Creator, these changes can occur only in a \nhuman being. \nThe Vedic cosmogonic descriptions begin already in the Rigveda,",

The essen- \ntials of the process change neither in SB nor in the oldest Upanisads. \nThe differences lie mainly its description. In early SB, the cognitive \ncharacter of the cosmogony is expressed in metaphors, the metaphor of \neating food and of the sexual act;!\u00b0 in later SB and the early Upanisads, \ndescriptions using abstract terminology appear more and more \nfrequently, although metaphors are also in use. \nIt goes beyond the scope of this paper to analyze all the reasons for \nthis continuity in cosmogonic conceptions, but two of them seem to be \nevident. The first is the Vedic assumption about the basic character of \nthe Rgveda: later literature constitutes its commentary, which has to \nexplain the details of Rgvedic thought rather than to formulate new \nmetaphysical postulates. The second 1s the possible repetition, under the \nguidance of a spiritual teacher, of the mystic experience of Rgvedic \npoets (kavi fst), during which the riddle of the world\u2019s creation and \nexistence was solved. \nIt is possible to find the references to various Vedic texts (RV, SB, \nBU, AU, TU and CU) in the pratityasamutpdada. It seems that the \nBuddha chose those cosmogonic descriptions which met two condi- \ntions: first, they explicitly express the cosmogony as transformations of \nthe Gtman; second, they preserve their cognitive meaning, even if they \nare taken out of the Vedic context.!! \n8This is the main thesis of my book \u201cKosmogonia Rygwedy : Mysl i metafora\u201d \n(\u201cThe Cosmogony of the Rgveda: Thought and Metaphor\u201d) forthcoming this \nyear (2000). \n*See Jurewicz 1995a, pp. I41\u2014-51, Jurewicz 1995b, pp. 109-28. \nl0See Jurewicz 1997, pp. 31-46. \n1'See below on, vijfidna, ndmardpa. the limitation of the number of the \nPlaying with Fire \nSI \nAt the same time, it seems that the Buddha (perhaps for polemical \npurposes) aimed greatly to simplify the Vedic ideas ; the most important \nresult of this is that he let go the cyclical character of the process: the \npratityasamutpdda is a simple, linear process.!* And finally, in formu- \nlating the notions which denote the successive links of the chain, he \nused abstract terminology instead of metaphors (which he made much \nuse of in his own explanations). !3 \nWe could say then, a bit paradoxically, that in this chain the \nBuddha extracted the essence of Vedic cosmogony and expressed it in \nexplicit language. \n1. avidya \nThe actual term avidyd does not appear in Vedic cosmogony.

Details the transition from pre-creative ignorance to creative ignorance in early texts, particularly examining how the Creator (atman) realizes his singularity and inability to cognize anything beyond himself. Expands into discussing samskara (formations) and how the Creator's wish for a \"second\" manifests in various Vedic texts.\n$2 \nJoanna Jurewicz \ninterpreted as expressing the impossibility of cognition. \nThis inability to cognize is different from the pre-creative one. It is \nthe state in which not every kind of cognition is impossible but only the \nsubject-object one. The two spheres, the hiding and the hidden, mark \nthe future subject-object division. But at this stage of creation both \nspheres are dark, so still identical, and cognition cannot be performed. \nUsing the Buddha\u2019s term, one could call it creative avidyd. \nThe later cosmogonic texts usually do not describe the pre-creative \nstate of unknowableness,!* but very often depict the second, creative \ninability to cognize, understanding it as the impossibility of subject- \nobject cognition exactly as inferred from the Nasadiya description. The \nmost explicit text is BU 1.4.: here the Creator (@tman) in the form of \nman (purusavidha) realizes his own singularity: he looks around and he \ndoes not see anything else but himself, which indicates not only that \nthere existed nothing aside from himself, but also that he was not able to \ncognize anything other than himself.!\u00b0 \nThe idea of the inability to cognize, the result of the absence of \nanything other than the Creator, is also expressed in the suggestive \nmetaphors of Agni the fire, who because of hunger attacks his Creator \n(SB 2.2.4.1-4), and of Death, identified with hunger, who looks for \nfood (BU 1.2.1). \nl4tts description appears in the descriptions of liberation, see for example BU \n4.3.23-32. \nISBU 1.4.1: Gtmaivedam agra Gsit purusavidhah | so \u2018nuvikya ndnyad Gtmano \n\u2018pasyatl; see also AU 1.1: dtma va idam eka evdgra Gsin ndnyat kimcana \nmisatl. It seems justified to associate the idea of winking expressed by the root \nVmis with the idea of being alive and awake, which in its turn is associated \nwith the possibility of cognition. It also seems probable that the idea of being \na not-cognizing Gtman may constitute one of the meanings of avidyd, which is \nthe source of all the successive events inevitably leading to entanglement in \nthe empiric world. This inevitability is also present in the Vedic cosmogony : \nonce Gtman manifested his inability to cognize, the rest of the creative process \nbecame a constant attempt to fill the epistemic and ontological gap which \nappeared in the perfect and full Absolute. \nPlaying with Fire \n83 \n2. samskara \nWhen the Creator asserts the absence of anything other than himself \nand his inability to cognize, the wish or desire for the presence of \u201ca \nsecond\u201d appears in him. In BU 1.2.1 this wish is expressed in the \nformula dtmanvi syam, because \u201cthe second\u201d is identical with the \nCreator; in other words, \u201cthe second\u201d is his own aGtman. '\u00ae \nThis cosmogonic Creator\u2019s wish to create the dtman is sometimes \nexpressed in SB by the subjunctive form of the verb sam Vkr (with or \nwithout abhi). Here, Prajapati wants to build himself (@tmanam) in the \nform of a fire altar, which is his body and the cosmos at the same time. \nHe exudes from himself his eating (subjective) and eaten (objective) \nparts. Then, he devours food with his eating part. Thus, Prajapati builds \nhimself up (a@tmdnam abhisamskaroti), which is a natural consequence \nof eating.!7 \nFor instance, in SB 6.2.1 Prajapati, wishing to find his son Agni \nhidden in the five sacrificial animals, says: \u201cThey are Agni. I want to \nmake them myself\u201d (SB 6.2.1.5: ime va agnir imadn evatmanam abhi-",

This analysis is part of a broader comparison between Vedic cosmogony and Buddhist thought.\n84 \nJoanna Jurewicz \nbhavisyami). He bakes the bricks in the fire and out of the torsos of the \nanimals he builds the altar; the heads he puts under the altar. Thus he \nreunites the heads of the animals with the torsos in the fire altar which is \nhimself, his own Gtman, and becomes the fire (SB 6.2.1.12: tato vai \nprajapatir agnir abhavat). \nThe creation of the second self described in the myth is the creation \nof the self in the process of eating. Agni\u2019s disappearance from \nPrajapati\u2019s range of view corresponds to the images of the internal void \nfelt by Prajapati, attested in many places in SB, which should be \nidentified with hunger.!? Prajapati\u2019s desire to find Agni is in fact the \ndesire to eat him. SB 6.2.1.15 identifies five animal forms of Agni with \nfood (anna).*\u00b0 The animals are prepared before eating: they are killed \nand their heads are separated from their torsos. The image of putting on \n(upa Vdha) the heads refers to the act of eating them, through which \nPrajapati puts the heads inside himself. It is not necessary to cook them \nbecause they are of fiery nature: they have mouths identified in the \nVeda with fire.2! The eating of the fiery heads allows Prajapati himself \nto obtain the mouth enabling him to eat food. We may conclude that the \nimage of the cooking of the torsos in the fire symbolizes not only the act \nof cooking food before it is eaten \u2014 lest it be eaten raw, which may \ncause death \u2014 but also the very act of eating food and digesting it in the \ninternal fire of the Creator. Thus, Prajapati, having eaten the fiery \nanimals, becomes the fire; he confirms his identity with the fire and at \nthe same time he regains himself in his atman. \nIt is important to see the similarity between SB\u2019s description and \nthe Upanisadic descriptions presented above: the image of Agni\u2019s \ndisappearance, and so of his absence, corresponds to the image in which \nthe Gtman realizes his singularity, so the absence of any object and the \nLOE g. 3.9.1.1, 10.4.2.2 where Prajapati feels empty (riricdna tva mene), 7.1.2.1 \nwhere the food is flowing out from Prajapati when he is relaxed. \n20In Tandyamahabrahmana 21.2.1 (in L\u00e9vi 1898, p. 25) the creatures run away \nfrom Prajapati fearing that he will eat them. \n-!See for example SB 7.1.2.4. \nPlaying with Fire \n85 \nimpossibility of its cognition.

This means that these a@tmans are also the fire altar and the \ncosmos, exactly like Prajapati\u2019s dtman in SB.23 They also have the same \nform of man as the Gtman (Creator) from BU 1.4. \nIf we reverse the process described in TU (which is justified on \nVedic grounds),2* we get the image of the creation of the successive \n221t is worth noticing that in the very image of hunger the ideas of avidyd and of",

The roots of classical yogic ideas seem to be here. \n25See SB 10.4.2.26, where Prajapati, having created three worlds identified \nwith the womb and with the ukhd, pours himself into them \u2014 made of metres, \nof hymns, of breaths, and of gods \u2014 identified with semen (sa esu trisu \nlokesiikhayam | yonau reto bhitam atmanam asificac chandomayam stoma- \nmayam pradnamayam devatamayam). The three worlds which are the womb \nand the ukhd, should be identified with the eater (the ukhd as the belly, that is, \nsomething which eats, appears in SB 7.5.1.38; in BU 1.4.6 the womb and the \nmouth and the internal part of hands are identified as those parts of atman \nwhich are hairless). The Prajapati\u2019s @tman \u2014~ made of metres, made of \nhymns, made of breaths, made of gods \u2014 is the eaten food. And this very act \nresults in creating the new dtman of Prajapati, which is expressed in forms of \nthe root sam Vkr: \u201cIn the course of a half-moon the first body (@tman) was \nmade up, in a further [half-moon] the next [body \u2014 Gtman], in a further one \nthe next \u2014 in a year he is made up whole and complete\u201d (translation in \nEggeling 1989, Vol. IV, p. 354, tasyardhamdase prathama Gtma samaskriyata \ndaviyasi paro daviyasi parah samvatsara eva sarvah krtsnah samaskriyata \\). \nThe process of creating a new Gtman for Prajapati is identified with the \nbuilding of the fire altar (SB 10.4.2.27); we may presume that his three \ndtmans enumerated above are the three citis of the altar corresponding to the \nearth, the antariksa, and the sky. One should remember, however, that in the \nfire altar we have five citis (there are two more: one between the citi \ncorresponding to the earth and that to the antariksa and one between the citi \ncorresponding to the antariksa and that to the sky). \n26This seems to contradict the claim made above that the pre-creative state is \nthe state of unknowableness. There are, however, many descriptions in the \nUpanisads which identify this state with the state in which cognition 1s \nimpossible (e.g. BU 4.3.23-32, 4.2.14). As explained there, the impossibility \nof cognition results from the Absolute\u2019s singularity. The idea of this \nsingularity is also present in the notion of dnanda, which is also used to \ndenote the bliss gained in the sexual act, during which the unity of the subject \nand the object is realized (as far as is possible), and this unity may be inter- \npreted in Vedic thought as the state of singularity of the subject: according to \nBU 1.4.3, when the Gtman wants to create his \u201csecond self\u201d he splits himself \ninto husband and wife and this division is the very creation of \u201cthe second\u201d. \nPlaying with Fire \n87 \nthe Creator\u2019s first manifestation, that of his consciousness ;77 the dtman \nmanomaya is the appearance of thought and of desire for a second self; \nthe appearance of the @tman prdnamaya and annarasamaya is the \ncreation of the second self which is alive and has a body thanks to \neating and drinking. \nThe above description of the cosmogony generally agrees with the \ncosmogonic descriptions of SB, in which Prajapati, having manifested \nhimself (a@tman vijidnamaya), wants to create his second self (atman",

On the other hand he lives in the new body acquired thanks \nto the act of eating it, see SB 6.2.1, quoted above. \n37This idea is present for example in SB 6.1.3, where the act of giving names to \nAgni and his assuming forms adequate to the names results in its being \nimpossible to recognize Agni as a whole: only his different forms are visible \n(SB 6.1.3.19: so\u2019yam kumaro riipdny anupravisan na va agnim kumaram iva \npasyanty etdny evdsya riipadni pasyanty etani hi riipadny anupravisat |). \nSimilarly, in BU 1.4.7 the division of the @tman into name and form causes it \nto become imperceptible as a whole: yathd ksurah ksuradhane \u2018vahitah syad \nvisvambharo va visvambharakulaye | tam na paSyanti | akrtsno\u2019hi sah | ... sa \nyo \u2018ta ekaikam updste na sa veda | akrtsno hy eso \u2018ta ekaikena bhavati \natmety evopasita | atra hy ete sarva ekam bhavantil.

Explores how the Buddha may have deliberately referenced and reframed Vedic fire imagery in formulating these links of the chain.\n94 \nJoanna Jurewtcz \nIf we posit that the Buddha referred to this image in formulating the \nvedand link, it is important to notice the difference between the descrip- \ntion of CU and the pratitityasamutpdda: in CU the consciousness of the \nsubject-object cognition precedes the act, whereas in the Buddha's \nchain, it comes after the act. On the other hand, we might argue that the \nnext link in the pratityasamutpdda is trsnd, which is the craving for \ncontinued subject-object acts, so it is possible to claim that here too \nvedand precedes the successive subject-object acts. \n8. trsnd, 9. upaddana \nThe process of Vedic cosmogony can be further expressed in the \nnext two links of the pratityasamutpdada, trsnd and upddana. \nAfter the final creation of the cosmos, human beings become the \nnext manifestation of the Creator\u2019s subjective power. This is clearly \nseen in the Rgvedic Nasadiya, according to which the Creator (tad \n\u00e9kam) manifests itself as the cosmos (abhi) and then divides into the \nsubjective part, constituted by the poets (kavdyas), and the objective \npart, constituted by the world cognized by the poets. Next, Nasadiya \ndescribes the poets\u2019 union with the world as they extend the ray (rasmi). \nThis image (apart from its other meanings) symbolizes the act of releas- \ning semen and the poets\u2019 sexual union with the world.47 This in turn \nsymbolizes the poets\u2019 cognitive act, as the very essence of their activity \nis the cognition and naming of reality. At the same time, the sexual \ncharacter of the metaphor strengthens the similarity of the act it \ndenote the act of recognizing tactile contact (tvdg vai grahah | sa \nsparsendtograhena erhitah | tvaca hi sparsan vedayate |). \n47See Jurewicz 1995a, pp 145-14; Jurewicz 1995b, pp. 120-24. BU 1.4.4, \nhaving presented a description of the birth of the human beings from the first \nsexual act between husband and wife, does not describe their creation but the \ncreation of different masculine parts of the Gtman, which \u2014 led by sexual \ncraving. we can presume \u2014 looks for the appropriate feminine parts in order \nto join with them sexually: s@ gaurabhavad vrsabha itarah | tam sam \nevabhavat | tato gadvo'jdvanta \n| vadavetarabhavad aSsvavrsa itarah | \ngardabhitara gardabha itarah | tam sam evabhavat \\ tata ekaSapham ajayata | \nand so forth. \nPlaying with Fire \n95 \nexpresses to the act expressed by the links of trsnd@: craving for another \nperson constitutes the basis of sexual activity.*8 \nIt is important to notice here that the poets\u2019 activity realizes on the \nmicrocosmic scale the cosmogonic activity of the Absolute.??

Traces how fire serves as both a metaphysical principle and creative force in early Vedic texts through to later Upanisadic works. Demonstrates the evolution of fire imagery from its role in cosmogony to its identification with consciousness and the self (atman).\nthe Veda, death appears in the beginnings of cosmogony and, identified with \nhunger and Agni, comprises desire. I would wonder, then, whether aggihutta \nshould be taken in its narrow, ritual meaning; it may be better to understand it \nas referring to fire as the metaphysical principle of cosmogony and life. \n56In RV trsnd is joined with the nirrti symbolizing the pre-creative state (1.38.6 \nmo su nah pdara-para nirrtir durhdnda vadhit | padistd trsnayd saha \\\\) or with \nthe enemies of the Aryans (RV 1.130.8) symbolizing the same (because they, \nare dark (e.g. RV 1.130.8), they are asleep (RV 4.51.3), they are not able to \ncognize (e.g. RV 3.18.2), to speak in a proper way (e.g. RV 3.34.10), or to \nperform sacrifices (e.g. RV 7.6.3)). \n>? This idea goes back to RV (e.g. the idea of apdm ndpat) and is developed in \nlater Vedic thought. Prajapati\u2019s Gtman is created in the process of burning \n(Vtap) and has the form of the fire altar; the confirmation of the Creator\u2019s \nidentity with fire constitutes the last act of the cosmogony. In SB 2.2.4 \ncreation is the act of blowing out the fire identified with prana. In SB 10.5.3 \nthe transformations of the manas end with the manifestation of fire. There are \nalso evident proofs that the idea of the Upanisadic Gtman goes back to the \nidea of fire, for instance the identification of Agni and Gtman with prdna and \nthe wind (already in RV 1.34.7, 7.87.2) and with the sun (RV 1.115.1, \n1.163.6). In RV 1.73.2 Agni is compared to the dtman. The Upanisadic \nevidence also attests the fiery nature of the @tman, who in the creative process \ntransforms through burning (BU 1.4, AU Vrap) and congealing under the \ninfluence of the warmth (AB Vmarch). See also BU 1.4.7, where the dtman \ndivided into names and forms is compared to the fire hidden in its nest (note \n37), and also CU 3.13.7\u2014-8, where the means of cognition of the Gtman are the \nmeans of cognition of the fire: rasyaisd drstih | (7) yatraitad asmif Sarire \nsamsparsenosnimdnam vijanati | tasyaisa Ssrutir yatraitat karndy apigrhya",

Through them Agni burns in the world he created. He \nburns voraciously and constantly needs fuel in order to exist. And this \nconstant, voracious devouring of the fuel and its digesting are expressed \nby updddana. The meaning of this word is both \u201cfuel\u201d and \u201csrasping\u201d.>8 \nThe first evokes the fire metaphor with its concrete meaning of burning \nfuel and eating food ; \nthe second is more abstract and refers to cognitive \nactivity.

This is also expressed by the Vedic metaphors for subject- \nobject contact: the metaphor of sexual union and the metaphor of eat- \ning, actions which result in a new existence or assure the continuation of \nthe existence achieved so far.\u00a9 \nSome similarities between the last three links of the pratityasamut- \npdda and the Vedic cosmogony may also be seen in AU, where the \ndtman, having created the cosmos and man (purusa), opens the top of \nthe head and is born in it, in order to recognize that it is he who is man* \nninadam iva nadathur ivagner iva jvalata upasrnoti |. \n58See Gombrich 1996, pp. 48, 67-69; also, Oldenberg 1994, pp. 223-24 \n\u201cSee Oldenberg 1994, pp. 223-24. \n60 What is more, it is the very cognitive act directed to an object which assures \nthe existence of the subject which ex definitione is the cognizing entity: at the \nmoment when the cognition is interrupted, it ceases to be the subject.

Thus, the Gtman exists in \nthe world before its birth and its death: its bhava precedes its jati and \njaradmarana. \nDescribing the existence of the a@tman in the form of an embryo \ninside the womb, AU several times uses the causative form of the verb \nVbhi in order to denote that his life is supported by his mother. It is not \nimpossible that the term bhava in the Buddha\u2019s chain refers to this very \nimage.\u00ae! The possible references to this part of AU could be confirmed \nby another, later Buddhist interpretation of the pratityasamutpdda, \naccording to which these three last links describe the existence that \nfollows the existence described in links 3-9 (vijnAadna \u2014 upddana). \nIn its description of the three births of the Gtman, AU stresses the \nreflexive character of this act, which is understood as the dtman\u2019s self- \ntransformations. The adtman existing in man as his semen is at the same \ntime the father \u2014 the giver of semen, and the semen itself \u2014 the \npotential offspring.

Examines how Buddha used familiar Vedic terms but subverted their meaning by removing the concept of atman (self), thereby transforming the Vedic creation story into a critique of meaningless transformations. Highlights Buddha's strategic use of Vedic concepts to demonstrate the futility of cosmogonic processes without an underlying self or absolute.\n100 \nJoanna Jurewicz \nhime lokah). This immediately makes one think of the idea of the \ndharmasamtdna which appears in the explanations of the pratitya- \nsamutpdda.\u00b0+ The difference is crucial: in the Vedic cosmogony \nlokandm samtdna is realized thanks to the self-transformations of the \ndtman; in the pratityasamutpdda, the dtman does not exist; there are \nonly changes.\u00ae> \nIt is surely significant that the /ocus classicus for the exposition of \nthe pratityasamutpdda is called the Mahanidanasutta. The word niddna \nappears in the cosmogonic context in RV 10.130.3: \u201cWhat was the \nprototype, what was the counterpart and what was the connection \nbetween them?\u201d (kdsit pramd pratima kim niddnam). In SB 11.1.6.3 \npratima is the cosmos identified with the fire altar, in SB 11.1.8.3 \npratima is sacrifice.\u00b0\u00a9 The pramd is Prajapati, the Creator, the niddna, \nthe link between the Creator and the creation: their identity. Thus \npramd and pratima resolve themselves into niddna which guarantees \nand expresses their identity. \nNiddna, denoting the ontological connection between different \nlevels and forms of beings, also refers to the epistemology: it also gives \nthe explanation of this connection.\u00a9\u2019 I presume that this is the first \nmeaning of niddna in the title of the Buddha\u2019s sermon. It is really \u201ca \ngreat explanation\u201d: there is no Gtman, the niddna of the cosmogony. \nThe negation of the ontological niddna constitutes the Buddha\u2019s \nmahanidana. \nI would like to propose a mental experiment here. The Buddha \npreached at least some of his sermons to educated people, well versed in \nBrahmanic thought, who were familiar with the concepts and the \ngeneral idea of the Vedic cosmogony. To them, all the terms used in the \npratityasamutpdda had a definite meaning and they evoked definite \nassociations. Let us imagine the Buddha enumerating all the stages of \n64Mejor 1996, p. 122. \n63See Gombrich 1996, p. 62. \n66Smith 1989. pp. 73-75. \n67Smith 1989. p. 79. \nPlaying with Fire \n10] \nthe Vedic cosmogony only to conclude: \u201cThat\u2019s right, this is how the \nwhole process develops. However, the only problem is that no one \nundergoes a transformation here!\u201d From the didactic point of view, it \nwas a brilliant strategy. The act of cutting off the @tman \u2014 or rather, \ngiven his fiery nature, the act of blowing him out \u2014 deprives all the \nhitherto well-defined concepts of their meanings and challenges the \ninfallibility of all their associations, exposing the meaninglessness, \nabsurdity even, of all the cosmogonic developments they express. \nThe similarities between the Vedic cosmogony and the pratitya- \nsamutpdda which I have been trying to show are too evident to be pure \ncoincidence. If we agree with the thesis that the Buddha in formulating \nthe pratityasamutpdda was referring to Vedic cosmogony, his chain \nshould be treated as the general model for Vedic cosmogony but \nnegating its metaphysical, cognitive, and moral sense. To apply the doc- \ntrine of anattad here would be to deny the Gtman as the metaphysical \nbasis of all cosmogonic transformations as well as its final forms as they \nsuccessively appear in the stages of the process. This deprives the Vedic \ncosmogony of its positive meaning as the successful activity of the \nAbsolute and presents it as a chain of absurd, meaningless changes \nwhich could only result in the repeated death of anyone who would \nreproduce this cosmogonic process in ritual activity and everyday life.",

The other model, the diachronic, \nis found in the (Up\u0101d\u0101na) Sam\u0101dhi Sutta (S 22.5).3 \n \n1.2  We are all incomplete parts and processes. Our \u201cindividuality\u201d or personhood is a mere process of \nmental states and physical events arising from ignorance, beginning from time immemorial and continu-\ning indefinitely into the future. The parts and processes that constitute us are called \u201cthe 5 aggregates\u201d \n(pa\u00f1ca-k,khandha), that is, form (r\u016bpa), feeling (vedan\u0101), perception (sa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101), volitional formations or \nmental volitions (sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra) and consciousness (vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a). These five groups do not, either singly or as a \ngroup (or in any way), constitute an independent unchanging entity (att\u0101)\u2014usually called \u201csoul\u201d or \u201cself\u201d \n\u2014since any notion of a permanent entity is ultimately an illusion. \nA proper understanding of the aggregates provides us with a view of physical and mental events (ie \nof \u201ceverything\u201d) that brings one closer to reality. In the first place, we have five physical sense-organs \n(the eye, ear, nose, tongue and body) and the 6th sense, the mind (the \u201csensing\u201d organ: simply put, it \nmakes sense of our physical experiences). Then there are the external sense-objects: physical form, \nsound, smell, taste and touch. Thoughts or \u201cmind-objects\u201d are also external sense-objects in the sense \nthat they arise through or are affected by contact with the external world (that is, by external stimuli). \n \n1.3  In the Buddhist texts, the external physical world is called form (r\u016bpa).4 As conscious beings, we \nhave a basic awareness or consciousness (vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a) of ourselves and our surroundings (living and non-\nliving): we are aware of \u201ca person,\u201d \u201ca colour,\u201d \u201ca fruit,\u201d etc, depending on conceptions, preconceptions \nand awareness (or lack of it).

When we are hungry and perceive a \u201cmango\u201d or any food, we feel a desire to consume it. \nWe are attracted to pleasant objects (we desire them), repulsed by unpleasant (we push them away), \nand simply disregard indifferent ones.7 \n \n1.4  In reality, the aggregates are not separate entities, but aspects of on-going conscious phenomena: it \nis a model for describing, understanding and liberating a living being, especially a human being. \u00d1\u0101\u1e47a-\nv\u012bra gives a very apt imagery for the five aggregates: a solid (form) pleasant (feeling) shady tree (percep-\ntion) \u201cfor lying under\u201d (formations) visible to me (consciousness).8 In other words, the aggregates are \ndynamic moment-to-moment experiences that arise in us throughout our lives. They are ever changing \nand do not constitute any lasting state or permanent \u201cself\u201d or \u201csoul.\u201d The Buddhist Dictionary provides a \nuseful clarification here: \n \n \nSome writers on Buddhism who have not understood that the five Khandhas are just classifi-\ncatory groupings, have conceived them as compact entities (\u201cheaps,\u201d \u201cbundles\u201d). Which actually, \nas stated above, the Groups never exist as such, ie they never occur in a simultaneous totality of \nall their constituents. Also those single constituents of a Group are present in any given body-\nand-mind process, are of an evanescent nature, and so also their varying combinations. Feeling, \nperception and mental formations are only different aspects and functions of a single unit of con-\nsciousness. They are to consciousness what redness, softness, sweetness etc, are to an apple and \nhave as little separate existence as those qualities.  \n \n \n \n \n \n      (BDict: khandha) \n \nSuch experiences by way of the aggregates (in various compositions) occur in all beings, whether \nthey are awakened or not.9 Awakened beings, like the Buddha and the arhats, do not cling to these \naggregates, but unawakened beings cling to them. As such, the aggregates of the awakened beings are \nsimply called \u201caggregates\u201d (khandha), while those of the unawakened beings are called \u201caggregates of \nclinging\u201d (that is, aggregates that are objects of clinging) (up\u0101d\u0101na-k,khandha). In the case of the \nawakened beings, the experience of such aggregates only affects them \u201cphysically\u201d or \u201cbodily\u201d\u2014simply \nbecause they have a physical body\u2014but not mentally. Their body is affected, but not their minds, which \nare not affected by the experiences of pain, pleasure or indifference. Unawakened beings are afflicted \nby both bodily pains and mental pains because of the aggregates of clinging.10  \n \n2 The aggregates of clinging \n \nThe aggregates of clinging (up\u0101d\u0101na-k,khandha) are more fully called \u201cthe five groups of existence \nthat form the objects of clinging\u201d (Vism 14.214 f/477 f). The Khandha Sutta (S 22.48) defines the aggre-\ngates of clinging as follows: \n \n \nAnd what, bhikshus, are the 5 aggregates of clinging? \n \nBhikshus, whatever kind of form there is,  \n                                                                                                                                                             \nin the sense of understanding things as they really are (yath\u0101,bh\u016bta).

The reason for this is that s\u00e2sava and up\u0101d\u0101n\u012bya do \nnot mean \u201caccompanied by influxes and by clinging,\u201d but \u201ccapable of being taken as objects of the \ninfluxes and of clinging.\u201d  \n \n4.2  In other words, even the arhat\u2019s mundane aggregates can be taken as objects of the influxes and of \nclinging by others (DhsA 347).17 In his verses, the elder Laku\u1e47\u1e6dhaka Bhaddiya,18 for example, declares: \n \n469  \nThose people who have judged19 me by appearance and who follow me by voice,20 \n \n \n \nOvercome by desire and passion, they know me not. \n \n \n470  \nThe foolish one, surrounded by mental hindrances, neither knows the inside \n \n \n \nNor sees the outside\u2013\u2013he is indeed misled by voice.  \n \n \n(Tha 469-472  A 2:71) \n \nIn the case of Vakkali, he was physically attracted to the Buddha\u2019s external form, and became a \nmonk just so that he could gaze upon the Buddha\u2019s physical beauty.21 \n \n4.3  The Sa\u1e41yutta Commentary says that while the form aggregate is of the sense-sphere, the other four \naggregates are of the other four spheres (sense sphere, form sphere, formless sphere, supramundane). \nAmongst the aggregates of clinging, stated in connection with the practice of insight, the form aggregate \nis of the sense sphere, while the others pertain to the three planes (sense sphere, form sphere, formless \nsphere) (SA 2:270). \n \n5 Up\u0101d\u0101na as fuel and fire \n \n5.1 Richard Gombrich, in his well-acclaimed work, How Buddhism Began, points out the relationship \nbetween the Buddhist conception of up\u0101d\u0101na (clinging) and its early Indian roots in metaphors of fuel \nand fire:  \n \nThe word up\u0101d\u0101na has both a concrete and an abstract meaning. In the abstract, it means \nattachment, grasping; in this sense it is much used in Buddhist dogmatics. Concretely, it means \nthat which fuels this process. The PED sv: \u201c(lit that [material] substratum by means of which an \nactive process is kept alive and going), fuel, supply, provision.\u201d So when the context deals with \nfire it simply means fuel\u2026. \n \nIn my opinion, it is clear that the term khandha too was a part of the fire metaphor. \n(Gombrich 1996:67)22 \n                                                 \n17 See S:B 1058 n65 & Bodhi, \u201cAggregates and Clinging Aggregates,\u201d 1976. See also Boisvert, 1995:29 f. \n18 For details, see \u201cThe Teacher or the Teaching?\u201d in SD 3.14.6. \n19 \u201cHave judged,\u201d p\u0101mi\u1e41su, lit \u201c(they) measured.\u201d \n20 \u201cWho follow me by voice,\u201d ye ca ghosena anvag\u016b, alt tr \u201cwho follow me by my voice.\u201d \n21 For Vakkali\u2019s story, see DhA 25.11/4:118 f; cf Vakkali S (S 22.87/3:119-124). \n22 Fire as a metaphor is also discussed by Gombrich 1987a:16-20.",

Introduces detailed explanations of the first two aggregates - form (r\u016bpa) and feeling (vedan\u0101) - as part of a comprehensive analysis of all five aggregates that constitute human experience in Buddhist thought.\nS 3.1.2.1.4      Sa\u1e41yutta Nik\u0101ya 3, Khandha Vagga 1, Khandha Sa\u1e41y 2, Majjhima Pa\u1e47\u1e47\u0101saka 1, Upaya Vg 4 \nhttp://dharmafarer.org   \n113 \nGombrich goes on to discuss the historical problem related to the Bh\u0101ra Sutta (S 22.22), where the \naggregates are said to be a burden (bh\u0101r\u0101 pa\u00f1ca-k,khandh\u0101) to be put down.23 The metaphor is more \nhistorically correct and spiritually more urgent when up\u0101d\u0101na-k,khandha is translated as \u201cthe aggregates \nthat are fuelled\u201d or \u201cthe aggregates that are on fire.\u201d It is a burden for the early brahmins to daily collect \nfuel (wood, herbs, etc) to feed the sacred fire (Gombrich 1996:67). Moreover, the flaming burden of fuel \nthat one carries around has to be immediately \u201cput down\u201d and \u201cput out.\u201d24  \n \n5.2 This usage\u2014up\u0101d\u0101na as \u201cfuel\u201d\u2014is found in the term, anup\u0101d\u0101,nibb\u0101na, \u201cthe nirvana without cling-\ning\u201d or \u201cfuel-free nirvana.\u201d Here, anup\u0101d\u0101 is mostly used before nouns, like a substantive in a compound, \nwhile an-up\u0101d\u0101ya is preferred before finite verb forms.25  \n \n6 A brief analysis of the 5 aggregates26 \n \n6.1 FORM.  \u201cForm\u201d (r\u016bpa) [3, 7] refers to the four great elements, both internal (as the body) and external \n(as another\u2019s body and as nature)\u2014see eg Mah\u0101 R\u0101hul\u2019ov\u0101da Sutta (M 62.8-12); also (Up\u0101d\u0101na) Pari-\nva\u1e6d\u1e6da Sutta (S 22.56).27 The Pali term n\u0101ma is rendered as \u201cname,\u201d which should not be taken literally. \n\u201cN\u0101ma is an assemblage of mental factors involved in cognition: feeling, perception, volition, contact and \nattention (vedan\u0101, sa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101, cetan\u0101, phassa, manasik\u0101ra, S 12.2).28 They are called \u201cname\u201d because they \ncontribute to the process of cognition by which objects are subsumed under the conceptual designa-\ntions\u201d (S:B 48). In other words, while n\u0101ma is centred on the mind (citta) and r\u016bpa is centred on the 4 \nprimary elements, notes Harvey, \u201cthere is no dualism of a mental \u2018substance\u2019 versus a physical \u2018sub-\nstance\u2019: both n\u0101ma and r\u016bpa each refer to clusters of changing, interacting processes.\u201d29 It should be not-\ned in the Nik\u0101yas30 that n\u0101ma,r\u016bpa does not include vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a (consciousness), which is actually its condi-\ntion, and the two are mutually dependent, like two sheaves of reeds leaning against one another (Nala,-\nkalapiya Sutta, S 12.67/2:114; also Mah\u0101 Nid\u0101na Sutta, M 12.21-22/2:63).31 \n \n6.2 FEELING (vedan\u0101), according to Boisvert (1995:53), is more than mere \u201c\u2018bare awareness\u2019 or \u2018anoetic \nsentience\u2019 [sensing without knowing]\u201d [Jayatilleke 1963:436], since it has some specific content: pleas-\nure, pain, neutral feeling; and that vedan\u0101 is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition, for the arising of \ncraving (the following link in the dependent arising cycle).32 The Ki\u1e6d\u0101giri Sutta (M 70) speaks of 2 kinds of \nfeelings: those of the householder (that conduce to unwholesome states), and those of the renunciant \n(that conduce to wholesome states) (M 70,6-7/1:475).33 \n                                                 \n23 S 22.22/3:25 f @ SD 17.14. \n24 Similarly, in (Khandha) \u0100ditta S (S 22.61/3:71) the aggregates are said to be on fire. Cf \u0100ditta,pariy\u0101ya S (S \n35.28/4:19 f)) where the 6 sense-organs, and their respective sense-objects, sense-consciousnesses, sense-con-\ntacts, feelings arising from the contacts are all burning with the fire of greed, hate, delusion and suffering.

In certain contexts, sa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101 may be rendered as \u201crecognition\u201d (Boisvert 1995:77 f), \nwhich, however, connotes that it is always a form of correct knowledge (when one \u201crecognizes\u201d some-\none or something, it means one has no doubt about this). Peter Harvey notes that: \n \nSa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101 certainly is a form of classificatory, labelling, interpreting activity, but it includes both cor-\nrect labelling (\u2018recognition\u2019) and incorrect labelling (misinterpretation). For this reason, I prefer \nthe more neutral \u2018cognition.\u2019 The more usual \u2018perception\u2019 is certainly too broad, as it covers the \ncombined activity of sa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101 and vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a, and in any case hardly covers sa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101 of a mental object.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  (Harvey 1996:94) \n \n \nG Bateson, in his well known work, Mind and Nature (1979) points out that \u201cPerception operates \nonly on difference. All receipt of information is necessarily the receipt of new of difference.\u201d (1979:31). \nHe goes on to compare the cognitive process to a simple electric switch: \n \n \nthe switch, considered as a part of an electric circuit, does not exist when it is in the on position. \nFrom the point of view of the circuit, it is not different from the conducting wire which leads to \nit and the wire which leads away from it. It is merely \u201cmore conductor.\u201d Conversely, but \nsimilarly, when the switch is off, it does not exist from the point of view of the circuit. It is \nnothing but a gap between two conductors which themselves exist only as conductors when the \nswitch is on.  \nIn other words, the switch is not except at the moments of its change of setting, and the \nconcept \u201cswitch\u201d has thus a special relation to time. It is related to the notion \u201cchange\u201d rather \nthan to the notion \u201cobject.\u201d  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  (Bateson 1979:108 f) \n \nIn other words, the switch is only what it does: it only exists at the time of switching. Otherwise it is \nno different from the rest of the circuit. \u201cHence,\u201d concludes Waldron, \u201ceven to speak of perception is \nnecessarily to speak of events\u2014and this is to speak in terms of dependent origination.\u201d (Waldron 2002: \n144). \n \n6.4 FORMATIONS.  \u201cFormation\u201d (sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra) literally means \u201cconstructing, construction\u201d (S 22.79/3:87).34 \nDue to its polysemy, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra is perhaps the most difficult early Buddhist term. Boisvert (1995: 91-112) \nidentifies 5 meanings of sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra: (1) as sa\u1e45khata; (2) as a paccaya; (3) as \u0101yu,sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra; (4) as part of \nsa,sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra and asa\u1e45kh\u0101ra, and (5) as a khandha.  \n \n(1) Sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra as sa\u1e45khata (S 3:87), ie conditioned phenomena, refers to all the universe; nirvana, \nhowever, is asa\u1e45khata (unconditioned). A conditioned phenomenon produces other conditioned pheno-\nmena in conjunction with vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a, vedan\u0101, sa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101 and r\u016bpa. In this narrower sense, it is identical to (5). \n(2) While (1) is the \u201cpassive\u201d conditioned state, sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra, as a paccaya (condition) or nid\u0101na (link) \n(as well as (5) khandha), is the active \u201cproducing\u201d or \u201cgenerating\u201d conditioner (S 2:5; Vbh 144, 173).35 \n(3) \u1fb9yu,sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra (D 2:99, 108; A 4:312; Kvu 2:559) is the same as bh\u0101va,sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra, ie as \u201cfuel\u201d to \nrebirth or the bhava link in dependent arising (2).  \n(4) Sa,sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra (with sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra) and asa\u1e45khara (without sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra) are used in connection with",

There \nis also the \u201cvolitional formations of striving\u201d (padh\u0101na,sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra), a designation for energy that accom-\nplishes the fourfold functions of right striving (samma-p,padh\u0101na), applied to the \u201c4 paths to spiritual \npower\u201d (iddhi,p\u0101da): desire or will power, energy, mind, investigation (S 51.13/5:5:268 f).  \n \n6.5 CONSCIOUSNESS  \n \n6.5.1 Vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a has been variously translated as \u201cbare sensation\u201d or \u201cpure consciousness,\u201d but Boisvert \n(1995) argues that far from being \u201cbare sensations devoid of any content\u201d (1995:117), it is \u201cprobably the \nfaculty needed for the cognition of pure percept, of sensation and of conceptualisation as well\u201d (118). \nConsciousness here is best understood in reference to the idea of citta,v\u012bthi or \u201cthe mind-process,\u201d \n\u201cfound fully developed in the commentaries, in skeletal form in the Pa\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na, and even alluded to in \nseed form in the Suttas.\u201d (Harvey 1996:95) \n \n \nIn this, what is known by \u201ceye-vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a\u201d is less than what is known eg by following \u201cmind-vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101-\n\u1e47a\u201d performing the function of \u201cdetermining.\u201d The first is visual awareness which discerns the \npresence of a visual object, and also discerns its basic components, labelled by accompanying \nsa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101. The second is discernment operating at a more abstract level, in unison with accompany-\ning sa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101 labelling the aspects so made out.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   (Harvey 1996:95) \n \n6.5.2  The key concept of the mind-process theory is the bhav\u2019a\u1e45ga, which literally translates as \u201cexist-\nence-factor\u201d and is often rendered as \u201clife-continuum\u201d or \u201cthe subconscious.\u201d It is \u201cthe resting state of \nconsciousness which occurs uninterrupted in dreamless sleep, and which is momentarily reverted to in \nwaking consciousness between each act of processing a sense-object.\u201d (Harvey 1996:95).

For a useful discussion, see Harvey 1993:3-5 (digital ed); also Karunadasa 1967:38 f & Boisvert 1995:37-42. \n48 There are 4 kinds of food or nutriment (\u0101h\u0101ra): solid food, contact (sense-stimuli), volition, consciousness (D \n3:228; M 1:48, 1:261; S 2:13, 48, 98-105; Vbh 401). Comys: They are so called because they nourish (aharanti) their \nown effects. Although there are other conditions for beings, these four alone are called \u201cfood\u201d because they serve \nas special conditions for the personal life-continuity (ajjhatika,santatiy\u0101 visesa,paccayatt\u0101) (MA 1:209; SA 2:26; \nDhsA 153). For edible food (kabali\u1e45k\u0101ra \u0101h\u0101\uf0a8a) is a special condition for the physical body of those beings who sub-\nsist on edible food. In the mental body, contact is the special condition for feeling, mental volition for conscious-\nness, and consciousness for name-and-form. The products of food (what it nourishes): (1) Edible food put into the \nmouth produces the groups of form with nutritive essence as the eighth (oja\u2019a\u1e6d\u1e6dhamaka,r\u016bp\u0101ni, an Abhidhamma \nterm for the simplest cluster of material states); (2) contact as food (phass\u2019\u0101h\u0101ra) produces the 3 kinds of feeling \n[pleasurable, painful, neutral]; (3) mental volition as food (mano,sa\u00f1cetan\u00e2h\u0101ra) produces the 3 kinds of existence \n[sense-world, form-world, formless world]; and (4) consciousness as food (vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47\u2019\u0101hara) produces name- and-form \n(n\u0101ma,r\u016bpa) at rebirth (MA 1:207 ff; SA 2:22-27; KhA 75 ff).

Presents the prevalent interpretation that dependent-origination describes how all phenomena depend on other factors for existence. Challenges this widespread view by arguing it deviates from the original meaning, which was focused specifically on mental processes rather than a universal principle of causation.\naspect of Buddhist philosophy, psychology and soteriology. Nonetheless, as will\nbecome evident in the following pages, we still lack a clear de\ufb01nition of what\ndependent-origination actually means. Different understandings, representing\ndistinct uses of the concept by numerous Buddhist teachers and schools, are\ngrouped together so as to cloud our view of the development of the teaching.\nThis paper intends to cut through the later layers of these developments so as to\nreveal the earlier, perhaps original uses of the concept.\nThe prevalent understanding of prat\u0131\u00aftya-samutpa\u00afda is that all factors of\nexistence depend on other factors in order to exist. Nothing exists on its own,\nno-thing possesses independent identity. This principle is said to apply to all\nmental as well as material phenomena. In the famous words of the suttas:\n\u2018\u2018When this is, that is. Once this arises, that arises. When this is not, that\nis not.

Commonly, the formula is read as a characterization of all\nthat exists. This view is adhered to by the majority of modern scholars\nwriting on the subject. Speci\ufb01cally, it is accepted by authors who discuss\nearly Buddhist doctrine. Many agree that Buddhism is not an ontological\nteaching, or was not so initially, and that its doctrinal emphasis is on the\nworkings of the mind.1 Nonetheless, it is generally believed that the Bud-\ndha described all things as pat:iccasamuppanna\u2014dependent arisings.2 A\ngood example is Steven Collins\u2019 classic Sel\ufb02ess Persons:\nIn considering the teaching of dependent origination, which Buddhism\nused to oppose Brahmanism on the conceptual level, it is crucially\nimportant to distinguish between the general idea of conditionality, and\nthe 12-fold series which has come to be the traditional way in which the\nteaching is expressed.\nHe continues to quote the formula quoted above, and says that\nThis general principle is idappaccayata\u00af, \u2018the fact of things having a\nspeci\ufb01c cause\u2019, which is said always to be the case even when there is no\nBuddha to penetrate it in depth and teach the full sequence.\u2019\u2019 (p. 106)\nCollins\u2019 words offer an example of the understanding that all \u2018\u2018things\u2019\u2019 exist\ndependently.

Nonetheless, both these sources\nbelieve the discussion of the mind to be a particular case of a more general philosophical principle\nrelating to all things.\n2 I will hereby refer to the noun pat:iccasamuppa\u00afda/prat\u0131\u00aftya-samutpa\u00afda as \u2018dependent-origination,\u2019\nand use the term \u2018dependently-arisen\u2019 for the adjective pat:iccasamuppanna/prat\u0131\u00aftyasamutpa\u00afda.\n298\nE.

The author argues against the widespread view that dependent-origination describes how all phenomena exist in dependence on other phenomena. Instead, the author contends that dependent-origination originally dealt solely with mental conditioning and the nature of self, rather than being a general ontological principle about reality.\nscholars support such a claim.3 Most popular is the view that the teaching of the\n12 links of dependent-origination\u2014which as we will soon see discusses the\nworkings of the mind\u2014is a \u2018\u2018particular case\u2019\u2019 of the more general principle of\nidappaccayata\u00af (\u2018\u2018dependence\u2019\u2019) and of the abstract formula quoted above.\nThis paper will claim that the reading of dependent-origination thus\ndescribed deviates signi\ufb01cantly from the initial meaning of the concept.\nAlthough the teaching does have ontological implications, it is not an\nontological teaching as such. In addition, these ontological implications differ\nfrom the ones generally ascribed to the doctrine, relating rather to certain\nphenomena being dependent on subjectivity. In clear distinction from\ndependent-origination as \u2018\u2018existence in dependence\u2019\u2019 and as the true nature of\nall phenomena, I will argue that dependent-origination addresses the workings\nof the mind alone. Dependent-origination should be understood to be no\nmore than an inquiry into the nature of the self (or better, the lack of a self).\nViewing prat\u0131\u00aftya-samutpa\u00afda as a description of the nature of reality in general\nmeans investing the words of the earlier teachings with meanings derived from\nlater Buddhist discourse. This results in a misrepresentation of much of what\nearly Buddhism was about.\nBefore we begin our analysis of the relevant materials, we must consider a\nnumber of methodological matters. Readers who regard the Pali Canon as an\nauthentic representation of \u2018\u2018what the Buddha taught\u2019\u2019 may prefer to skip the\nnext section.\n3 Nyanatiloka (1971, p. 155), Varma (1971, p. 124), Rahula (1974 [1959], p. 53), Kalupahana (1975;\np. 55\u2014where he quotes Buddhaghosa who believes pat:iccasamuppa\u00afda characterizes \u2018\u2018coordinate\nphenomena,\u2019\u2019 and explains it as \u2018\u2018that which has arisen dependent on causes,\u2019\u2019 p. 59\u2014where he\naccepts Buddhaghosa\u2019s view, and most clearly\u2014p. 89), Wayman (1980, pp. 276\u2013279), Yamada\n(1980, pp. 267, 275\u2013276), Vetter (1988, p. 45), Nakamura (1989 [1980], p. 69, although I am not\nperfectly clear about what he means by \u2018\u2018all phenomena which appear\u2019\u2019), Harris (1991, p. 138),\nNagao (1991, pp. 174\u2013176), Bodhi & N\u02dc a\u00afn:amoli (1995, p. 1233, n. 408), Boisvert (1995, pp. 8\u20139),\nHamilton (1996, p. 68), Ronkin (2005, p. 200), and Kragh (2006, pp. 271\u2013272, especially n. 441).\nLamotte (1988, pp. 35\u201340), although clearly emphasizing the mental aspect of the dependent-\norigination - \u2018\u2018\u2026[T]he complex mechanism which indissolubly links desire to action and action to\npainful rebirth\u2019\u2019 (pp. 35\u201336) - also speaks of the teaching as characterizing \u2018\u2018all the phenomena of\nexistence\u2019\u2019 (pp. 36, 40). In the same context, he reads the anatta doctrine as a teaching regarding\nthe insubstantiality of all things, and suggests that dependent-origination supplements this insight\nby explaining how insubstantial phenomena appear and disappear (p. 36). He also understands\nprat\u0131\u00aftyasamutpa\u00afda as a middle way between existence and non-existence, basing himself on the\nKaccanagotta-sutta (for a discussion of this last point see Section \u2018\u2018The Middle Path\u2019\u2019 below,\nespecially note 31).

Appears in a research paper examining the original meaning of dependent-origination (prat\u012btya-samutp\u0101da) in early Buddhism. Provides justification for why, despite issues of authenticity and dating, the Pali texts can be considered reliable sources for understanding core Buddhist doctrinal concepts.\nQuestions of Authenticity\nIn speaking of early understandings of dependent-origination I will be relying\non materials from the Pali Canon. Such a use of Pali texts is notoriously\nproblematic, as it is more than clear that these scriptures have been worked\nover by many generations of Buddhists.4 Hence it is necessary to explain why I\nbelieve I may use the Pali texts as evidence for prominent trends in the early\nBuddhist community.\nAlthough there are many problems regarding the authenticity of the Pali\nCanon, the major issue concerns the antiquity of the materials.5 The oldest\nsources we have to work with in Pali in order to assess the date of the suttas\nare commentaries from the \ufb01fth and sixth centuries A.D. The Chinese A\u00af gama\ntexts parallel to the Pali suttas are slightly earlier, dating from the fourth\ncentury A.D. In addition, we are in no position to assess the precise contents\nof the Pali canon redacted towards the end of the \ufb01rst century B.C. at\nAlu-viha\u00afra.6 Another problem is posed by the different \u2018\u2018layers\u2019\u2019 the canonical\ntexts seem to be composed of.7\nAlthough this situation is clearly problematic when discussing Buddhist\nhistory, I wish to argue it is not nearly as perturbing when discussing such\ncentral doctrinal concepts as prat\u0131\u00aftya-samutpa\u00afda. In dealing with foundational\narticulations of doctrine, it is implausible to argue that they ceased to re\ufb02ect\ntheir original meanings when the oral teachings were committed to writing. It\nis also unlikely that time worked on such central notions so as to give them\ncompletely new forms. In a case like pat:iccasamuppa\u00afda, it is likely that the\nwords of the Pali suttas are relatively close to the earlier meanings of the term.\nThis argument is particularly strong when dealing with a concept like\ndependent-origination, which possesses explicit philosophical and analytic\n4 For important discussions of these issues see Schopen (1985), Vetter (1988), Gombrich (1996,\nmost importantly chaps. 1 and 4), and Bronkhorst (1998, whose methodological position is much in\nline with the one I adopt here, although he is somewhat more liberal). For a general assessment of\nthe problem, see Schmithausen (1990).\n5 One other problem regards the language of the Canon, as the original teachings were probably\nnot given in Pali. The Pali canon was also translated a number of times, and the teachings were\naffected by the \u2018\u2018Sanskritization\u2019\u2019 of the vernaculars and of the Pali. See Lamotte (1988, pp. 558\u2013\n568) and Norman (1983, pp. 2\u20137, 1989) for more elaborate discussions. A second problem is that\nthe canon is the written adaptation of teachings originally given and preserved orally. We will\nprobably never know precisely what was gained and lost in this process. On the signi\ufb01cant dif-\nferences between oral and written traditions see Ong (1982). For a good summary of the questions\nregarding the oral character of the canon see Wynne (2004).\n6 In the short discussion conducted here I will refrain from addressing Schopen\u2019s claim (1985) that\nin As\u00b4oka\u2019s Bha\u00afbra\u00af Edict, the oldest reference to Buddhist scriptures we possess, seven texts are\nmentioned, the majority of which can not be identi\ufb01ed with materials familiar to us today. In\nresponse, I will con\ufb01ne myself to the following short notes: First, as has become clear by now,\ndifferent titles do not necessarily imply different contents, a point made in relation to the Bha\u00afbra\u00af\nEdict by Lamotte (1988, pp. 235\u2013237) as well.

It could be argued that oral traditions would be fairly scrupulous in\npreserving the original intentions of materials of this sort.8\nThe considerations I am suggesting are further corroborated by a number\nof comparative works. Minh Ciau (1991) conducted a comprehensive study,\ncomparing the contents of the Pali Majjhima Nika\u00afya with the Chinese\nMadhyama-A\u00af gama. Although he found a plethora of distinctions between the\ncanons regarding technical and practical issues,9 he discovered a striking\nagreement in doctrinal matters.10 Such conclusions were reached also by\nLamotte (1988, p. 156):\n\u2018\u2018[W]ith the exception of the Maha\u00afya\u00afnist interpolations in the Ekottara\n(-a\u00afgama), which are easily discernable, the variations in question affect\nhardly anything save the method of expression or the arrangement of the\nsubjects. The doctrinal basis common to the a\u00afgamas and nika\u00afyas is\nremarkably uniform.\u2019\u2019\nBased on such observations we can agree that Pali Canon materials were\ngenerally accepted in the IVth century A.D.\nAnother interesting piece of evidence will allow us to extend these\nconclusions back to the \ufb01rst two centuries A.D. Basing himself on Gandha\u00afran\nmanuscripts from the Robert Senior collection, Andrew Glass (2006)\ncompared su\u00aftras from the beginning of the second century A.D. with their\nTibetan, Sanskrit, Pali and Chinese counterparts. Although his sample is\nsmall, based on only four short su\u00aftras, his conclusions are much in line with\nthose reached by Minh Ciau and Lamotte. Again we \ufb01nd technical differences\nand doctrinal unity. The translations read much like the more familiar ones\nfrom the Pali, and are clearly examples of the same Buddhist attitudes to life\nand reality. According to Richard Salomon (1999, ch. 1), the materials con-\ntained in the fragments from the British Library collection, which date from\nthe beginning of the \ufb01rst century A.D, do not diverge signi\ufb01cantly from better\nknown traditions in regard to central points of doctrine as well.\nThe studies mentioned, although not conclusive, support the view that the\nPali suttas re\ufb02ect Buddhist scriptures in circulation at the beginning of the \ufb01rst\nMillenium A.D. In fact, this discussion brings us very close to the Alu-viha\u00afra\nredaction of the canon in the last quarter of the \ufb01rst century B.C. Therefore, I\n8 I must remark that I would be less enthusiastic about generalizing these suggestions to questions\nof practice, although they could hold some ground there as well. Obviously, on minute points of\nboth conduct and doctrine this argument will not carry us very far.\n9 Major technical differences exist in the arrangement of the materials, as well as regarding titles\nof su\u00aftras, their setting (Nida\u00afna), the interlocutors, etc. Examples of differences of practical nature\ninvolve the monks carrying sitting-cushions in the Chinese tradition and conducting a retreat in\nthe summer, while their Indian Thesava\u00afdin brothers meditate without cushions during the rain-\nseason. The Chinese edition also ignores a sutta such as the J\u0131\u00afvaka-sutta of the MN, which allows a\nmonk to eat three types of meat. The reason for the exclusion was the vegetarianism practiced in\nthe Sarva\u00afstiva\u00afda, the school whose canon the Chinese Madhyama-a\u00afgama is a translation from.\n10 This agreement led him to believe that they were both translations of an original Magadhi\ncanon.\nEarly Meanings of Dependent-Origination\n301\n123",

Introduces the analysis of the \"12 links\" teaching as a central framework for understanding dependent-origination in early Buddhism.\nbelieve it fair to claim that with regard to central doctrinal concepts we can\nregard the materials in the Pali Canon as representative of major Buddhist\ntrends in the last few centuries B.C. By no means am I suggesting that these\nmaterials can be seen as an accurate representation of the words of the\nBuddha. But they are probably not very far off the mark, at least in essence,\nand can be seen as representative of views held by early generations of\nBuddhists.\nIn order to further substantiate my position, my presentation of pat:ic-\ncasammuppa\u00afda in the Pali Canon will discuss only materials contained in\nthe four major Nika\u00afyas.11 Speci\ufb01cally, I will focus on discourses contained\nin the most elaborate discussion of dependent-origination in the canon, the\nNida\u00afna-sam: yautta (NS) of the SN.

Both Hamilton (1996) and Harvey (1995) rely on the suttas contained in these\nfour collections, believing them to be early Buddhist traditions.\n12 It is true that there must have been differences between the different traditions of transmission\nof each of the four Nika\u00afyas (see, for example, Kragh [2006, p. 15 n. 13]). Nonetheless, from the\nperspective of this study they can be seen as expressing a common doctrine.\n13 The links are not necessarily 12 in number. At times the list is longer (for example MN i54),\nshorter (for example DN ii55) or re-arranged.

As stated above, the\nlinks are not always 12 in number, and their sequence is altered on number of occasions.\nThis points to the fact that they can be understood as a later standardization of the\nteaching, attempting to give it coherent and uni\ufb01ed form. For a more detailed discussion,\nsee Collins (1982, p. 106), who summarizes the work of a number of scholars, and Ronkin\n(2005, p. 201). Bucknell (1999) addresses the major questions regarding this discussion, and\noffers a number of interesting suggestions regarding the process by which the formula was\nsynthesized. A quite different analysis of this synthesis is offered by Schmithausen (2000).\nFollowing Frauwallner, and basing himself on the Sarva\u00afstiva\u00afda Maha\u00afnida\u00afna-su\u00aftra, Schmit-\nhausen discusses three different sequences which serve as the basis for the later arrange-\nment of the 12 links. He believes these three sequences to have been connected by the\ncomplier of the Maha\u00afnida\u00afna-su\u00aftra, so as to form a series of nine nida\u00afnas, to which a tenth.\ns:ad: a\u00afyatana, was added for clari\ufb01cation. Later on the series was extended with the use of\nsam: ska\u00afra and avidya\u00af to form the 12 link formula we are occupied with here. Another\ninteresting related work is Nakamura (1980), who discussed what may be the earliest\nexpressions of the process of mental conditioning described by the 12 links. Nakamura\ndiscusses materials from the Sutta-nipa\u00afta, in which there are fewer links that also exhibit\ndifferences in their titles and sequence. Wayman (1971, p. 185) is a dissident voice to this\ndiscussion, saying that he is \u2018\u2018convinced that the full 12 members have been in Buddhism\nsince earliest times.\u2019\u2019\n15 All the different lists of conditioning appearing in the Canon are, in my view, based on\nthe same principle of mental conditioning. They describe the manner in which different\nelements of experience are brought into existence (samutpa\u00afda) conditioned (prat\u0131\u00aftya) by\nprevious subjective acts. Note, however, that Schmithausen de\ufb01nes the third sequence of the\nMaha\u00afnida\u00afna-su\u00aftra, which traces the process of conditioning from vijn\u02dca\u00afn: a, through na\u00afmaru\u00afpa\nand spar\u0001sa, to vedana\u00af (links 3\u20134, 6\u20137 of the 12 link formula), as involving a \u2018\u2018biological-\nfunction of mind\u2019\u2019 (see Schmithausen [1987, p. 37]). He thus de\ufb01nes vijna\u00afn: a as the subtle\ntransmigrating consciousness, and na\u00afmaru\u00afpa as mind-matter coalescing into a \u2018\u2018proto-em-\nbryo,\u2019\u2019 the material body to which consciousness connects in the womb. Such a reading of\nvijn\u02dca\u00afn: a and na\u00afmaru\u00afpa emphasizes the bodily aspect of the conditioning. But these \u2018\u2018bio-\nlogical\u2019\u2019 elements are also conditioned by previous acts of desire. Thus they too are a result\nof subjective conditioning. Understanding prat\u0131\u00aftya-samutpa\u00afda in this way, as an expression of\nprocesses of mental conditioning, has the merit of applying to all the different canonical\nexpressions of dependent-origination, including the relevant teachings that were not included",

The teaching is concerned with an\nanalysis of the workings of the mind, with identifying the different processes of\nmental conditioning and describing their relations. The 12 links do not deal with\nhow things exist, but with the processes by which the mind operates.\nIt is true that the doctrine of the 12 links has important ontological\nimplications. It is based on a metaphysics which seems to believe that\nobjects\u2014real objects!\u2014are conditioned by consciousness. Such an under-\nstanding is implied by the fact that form (ru\u00afpa) and the objects of the senses,\nthe \u2018\u2018external\u2019\u2019 side of links four and \ufb01ve, are conditioned by mental dispo-\nsitions and consciousness (links two and three).22 The same metaphysics is\n18 The term bhava could probably best be translated as \u2018\u2018birth,\u2019\u2019 although in a different sense from\nthe one implied by the eleventh link (ja\u00afti). Bhava probably means a state of existence, a rebirth as\na creature in any one of the different realms. Such a reading of bhava has been suggested by\nnumerous scholars, among them Lamotte (1988, p. 38), and Williams (1974, p. 59). For a more\nextensive discussion of the possible meanings of the term, see Schmithausen (2000, pp. 52\u201353).\n19 Nyantiloka (1971, pp. 156, who relies on Buddhaghos:a). Collins (1982, pp. 203\u2013205) relates to\ndifferent classi\ufb01cations of the 12 links into three distinct life-times. Wayman (1980, pp. 286\u2013291)\ngives different rendering of the teaching according to periods of one, two or three lifetimes.

Schmithausen (2000, p. 45) makes the insightful remark that the theory\nof three rebirths implied by the 12 links is actually an unintended consequence of the combination of\nthree discrete, archaic conditioning sequences. See note 14 for a further discussion of this view.\nModern authors often prefer to view these different \u2018\u2018births\u2019\u2019 metaphorically.\n20 Harvey (1995, pp. 134\u2013137, 159).\n21 Nyanatiloka (1971) argues against such a view in his introduction to the 12 links. Yamada\n(1980, p. 271) believes the \u2018\u2018natural sequence\u2019\u2019 of the links to work simultaneously rather than\ngradually.

The point is that one is reborn in direct relation to acts of\nattachment conducted during his or her previous life/lives. These forms of\nconditioning undermine the realistic ontology normally attributed to early\nBuddhism.23 It may be argued in response that the Buddha is speaking only\nabout experience, in complete disregard for the way objects \u2018\u2018really\u2019\u2019 exist. But\nsuch an argument demands too heavy a distinction between mental objects\nand the non-mental world they represent. It also ignores the metaphysics\nimplied by the theory of karma,24 of special relevance to our discussion\nbecause of the traditional connection between karma and the 12 links.25 Such\nan interpretation also fails to take into account concepts like manomaya (\u2018\u2018the\nmind made body\u2019\u201926) along with the other supernatural powers ascribed to the\nreligious adept, and disregards the religious context from which the Buddha\nemerged.27\nThese intuitions regarding the nature of the relation between mental con-\nditioning and the objective world suggest that the mind has power over objects\nbeyond what we normally believe. They suggest that ontology is secondary to\nexperience. What we are, including the material aspects of our being, is\nconditioned primarily, if not only, by our previous subjective maneuvers. But\nthese conjectures, although revealing much about underlying Buddhist incli-\nnations, are not really what the 12 links formula is about. The 12 links are an\nexplanation of mental conditioning, an analysis of subjective existence. They\ndo not deal directly with the manner in which all things exist. The ontological\nimplications are no more than an offshoot of the discussion, possibly an echo\nof the Upanis:adic notions regarding the relations between the Self and the\ncosmos (see Section \u2018\u2018Dependent - Origination Contextualized\u2019\u2019 below).\nSo far, what I have been saying about the 12 links is not very new. The fact that\nthey deal with subjective existence rather than external reality should come as no\nsurprise.

The relevance of the \ufb01rst point to understanding the\nBuddhist theory of karma is generally acknowledged in scholarly literature. The second clearly\ndeserves a separate analysis.\n25 Cox (1993, pp. 121\u2013123) has argued that we need not necessarily assume that the connection\nmade between karma and dependent-origination was original. Nonetheless, at least in regard to\nthe 12 link formula, as it is presented here, these two central concepts are naturally connected.\n26 For a discussion of manomaya see Hamilton (1996, ch. 7), as well as Harvey (1995, ch. 8).\n27 Jurewicz(2000)has discussed the relationsbetween the terms whichconstitutethe 12 links and their\norigins in Vedic theories of creation and sacri\ufb01ce.

Examines textual evidence to argue that dependent-origination deals exclusively with mental conditioning through the 12 links, rather than being a general principle about all phenomena. Challenges the common interpretation that dependent-origination refers broadly to how all things exist in dependence on other things.\nthat is\u2014exists in dependence.\u2019\u2019 We are concerned with the meaning of the\nabstract formula quoted above, as well as with the meaning of the term\nidappaccayata\u00af.\nI am arguing that the abstract formula of dependent-origination deals exclu-\nsivelywiththeprocessencapsulatedinthe12links.WhentheBuddhasays\u2018\u2018When\nthis is, that is, etc.,\u2019\u2019 he is speaking only of mental conditioning, and is saying\nabsolutely nothing about existence per se. The most signi\ufb01cant evidence for this\nfact is that the phrase \u2018\u2018imasmim: sati idam: hoti\u2026\u2019\u2019 never occurs detached from the\narticulation of the 12 links, save one occurrence which I will relate to below.\nLet us examine a standard appearance of the abstract formula. In the\nDasa-bala-sutta of the Nida\u00afna-Sam: yutta, the Buddha says: \u2018\u2018Imasmim: sati idam:\nhoti... yad idam: avijja\u00af paccaya\u00af\u2026\u2019\u2019 (When this is, that is\u2026 That is: depending\non ignorance\u2026). The abstract formula is followed by yad idam: , followed by\nthe standard articulation of the 12 links. If the yad idam: meant \u2018\u2018for example\u2019\u2019\nor \u2018\u2018such as,\u2019\u2019 we could accept the view that the 12 links are a private case of a\ngeneral principle of conditionality. But it clearly does not. What it does\nexpress is more akin to \u2018\u2018that is,\u2019\u2019 or even more precisely \u2018\u2018that which is.\u2019\u2019\nHence it should be clear that the abstract formula relates precisely and only to\nthe mutual conditioning of the 12 links. This is in fact exactly what it says:\n\u2018\u2018When this (i.e. ignorance, etc.) is, that (i.e. mental dispositions, etc.) is.\nOnce this (again\u2014ignorance, etc.) arises, that arises. When this is not,\nthat is not. Once this ceases, that ceases.\u2019\u2019\nImasmim: sati idam: hoti, imass\u2019 uppa\u00afda\u00af, idam: uppajjati.\nImasmim: asati, idam: na hoti, imassa nirodha\u00af idam: nirujjhati\nThere is no reason to believe that dependent-origination originally discussed\nanything but mental conditioning. This is evident in the words of the Buddha in\nthe classic exposition of the 12 links quoted above: \u2018\u2018And what, monks, is\ndependent-origination?\u2019\u2019 (katamo ca, bhikkhave, pat:iccasamuppa\u00afdo?) he asks.\nThe answer is a teaching of the 12 links: \u2018\u2018Dependent on ignorance, monks\u2026\u2019\u2019\nThe 12 links are pat:iccasamuppa\u00afda. As I said earlier, there is one case in which\nthe abstract formula appears without the 12 links, in the Cu\u00afl: asakuluda\u00afyi-sutta\n(MN ii32). But this occurrence is unable to alter our conclusions. The context in\nwhich the formula appears involves a discussion regarding recollection of past\nlives, an issue closely related to what the 12 links are about. The Buddha is again\nspeaking about the process of karmic mental conditioning.\nThe same conclusions reached in regard to the abstract formula apply to the\nterm idappaccayata\u00af as well.28\nAnoft-quotedpassageregardingdependent-origination,usuallyunderstoodas\nan example of dependent arising referring to all phenomena, appears in the\n28 The Paccaya-sutta of the NS (SN II. 25) shows that idappaccayata\u00af relates to the 12 links. In the\nAriyapariyesana\u00af-sutta (MN i167), when the Buddha hesitates before teaching the dharma, he\nexpresses his doubt that people will penetrate idappaccayata\u00af, which he equates with pat:icca-\nsamuppa\u00afda. In this case there is again no reason to believe the Buddha is speaking of anything but\nmental conditioning.\nEarly Meanings of Dependent-Origination\n307\n123",

Presents textual evidence that even when discussing material phenomena like the body or five aggregates, dependent-origination relates only to objects created through mental conditioning processes.\nPaccaya-sutta (SN II.25). There the Buddha says \u2018\u2018Monks, I will teach you\ndependent-origination\nand\ndependently-arisen\nphenomena\u2019\u2019\n(pat:icca-\nsamuppa\u00afdan\u02dcca vo bhikkhave desessa\u00afmi pat:iccasamuppanne ca dhamme).\n\u2018\u2018Dependently-arisen phenomena (pat:iccasamuppanne dhamma\u00af)\u2019\u2019 are presum-\nablyanypossibleobject.Butinfact,ratherthanexplaininghow\u2018\u2018phenomena\u2019\u2019 are\n\u2018\u2018dependently-arisen\u2019\u2019, the sutta continues with the Buddha teaching the 12 links.\nHe next gives an interesting description of each of the links as \u2018\u2018impermanent,\ncompounded, dependently-arisen, characterized by waning, by fading, by stop-\nping, by destruction\u2019\u2019 (aniccam: sa_nkha\u00aftam: pat:iccasamuppannam: khayadhammam:\nvayadhammam: vira\u00afgadhammam: nirodhadhammam: ). The connection between\nbeing dependently-arisen (pat:icccasamuppanna) and being impermanent (anic-\nca) and compounded (sa_nkha\u00afta) is again emphasized in SN III. 97\u2013100 and SN\nIV.211\u2013214. In the \ufb01rst case the context relates again to a number of the 12 links.\nThe second case relates \ufb01rst to the body, and then to the sixth link (phassa).\nThese last cases point to the fact that when the Buddha refers to phenomena\nas dependently-arisen he is referring only to objects created by the process of\nconditioning encapsulated bythe 12 links. Admittedly, in SN IV.211 he speaksof\nthe body. But the body is no more than a product of attachment, a material\nexpression of the process of conditioning whose major locus is experience. This\nis another case which points to the ontological implications of the 12 links, but\nwhich is still in accord with the hypothesis that dependent-origination deals only\nwith mental conditioning and the phenomenal aspects affected by it.\nAnother discourse we should consider is the Maha\u00afhatthipadopama-sutta\n(MN i184). In this sutta the Buddha de\ufb01nes the \ufb01ve aggregates as depen-\ndently-arisen. He does so after he has emphasized their composite and\nimpermanent nature, including an explanation of the material aspect of the\nru\u00afpa aggregate based on the four elements. In the process he goes so far as to\nsay that this material aspect is external (ba\u00afhira\u00af). He continues by saying that:\nWhoever sees dependent-origination sees the dhamma, and whoever\nsees the dhamma sees dependent-origination. Dependently arisen indeed\nare these \ufb01ve aggregates of clinging.29 The desire toward, inclining\ntoward, basing oneself on, and craving for these \ufb01ve aggregates of\nclinging, is the arising of suffering. The stopping and quitting of desire\nand passion toward these \ufb01ve aggregates is the cessation of suffering.\nyo pat:iccasamuppa\u00afdam: passati so dhammam: passati, yo\ndhammam: passati so pat:iccasamuppa\u00afdam: passat\u0131\u00afti.\npat:iccasamuppanna\u00af kho pan\u2019 ime yadidam pan\u02dcc\u2019\nupa\u00afda\u00afnakkhandha\u00af.

The object under discussion is the \ufb01ve aggregates,\nwhich are clearly conditioned by the 12 links. By saying that bhava is condi-\ntioned by upa\u00afda\u00afna, the 12 links state that rebirth is caused by the attachments\nof this life. The aggregates come into being in relation to clinging, and are\ntherefore characterized as dependently-arisen.\nThe examples quoted\u2014rare occurrences in which \u2018\u2018phenomena\u2019\u2019 are said\nto be dependently-arisen\u2014make clear that dependent-origination is not a\nteaching which characterizes all objects. The Buddha seems not to have\nsaid that all things arise dependent on their conditioning. In fact, he may\nhave condemned such a statement an unhealthy speculative view. When the\nBuddha did describe something as dependently-arisen, he was referring\nonly to phenomenal aspects of sam: sa\u00afric experience. Another point worth\nnoting is that saying that something is pat:iccasamuppanna supplements the\nfact that it is impermanent and compounded. Phenomenal aspects such as\nthe aggregates arise conditioned by grasping, and are therefore of impure\nand of a passing nature. Hence they will lead to pain and are not to be\nregarded as self.\nA similar reading of the 12 links in the early suttas, anticipating the major\nthrust of the discussion conducted so far, has been presented by Collett Cox\n(1993). Cox traces the path by which Sarva\u00afstivada Abhidharma philosophers\ncame to understand dependent-origination as an abstract theory of causation.\nWell aware of the dangers of reading later doctrinal developments into earlier\narticulations of Buddhist insight, Cox de\ufb01nes the shifts in meaning the doc-\ntrine of causality underwent, from the early suttas through the earlier stages of\nSarva\u00afstiva\u00afda Abhidharma. In the early suttas, she claims, pat:iccasamuppa\u00afda\ndoes not function as an abstract theory of causation. Rather, it focuses on the\nway human suffering is produced and the manner by which it may be termi-\nnated. Later on Buddhist philosophers developed this early insight into a full-\n\ufb02edged model of causality. Cox does not speci\ufb01cally address the question I\nhave been concerned with here\u2014whether prat\u0131\u00aftya-samutpa\u00afda relates to all\nthings, rather than dealing exclusively with mental phenomena. Nonetheless,\nthe suggestions I have been making \ufb01t well with the manner in which she\nportrays the developments undergone by of the concept of dependent-origi-\nnation: originally a purely psychological insight, eventually an abstract\nphilosophical principle.\nAs I said earlier, the teaching of dependent-origination does have\nontological implications. But although the view of reality it implies is\nstimulating, we should be careful not to over-emphasize the point. First,\nthis compelling statement does not seem to be given much emphasis in the\nscriptures. Second, that the Buddha is talking about anything more than\nexperience still needs to be shown. Most importantly, although this view is\ninteresting philosophically, its true context is psychological. What I wish to\nstress for now is that if the Nika\u00afya suttas refer at all to \u2018\u2018things\u2019\u2019 being\nEarly Meanings of Dependent-Origination\n309\n123",

Or rather,\nbecause we grasp at our selves.\nThe Middle Path\nIn order to further substantiate our understanding that dependent-origination\ndeals only with subjective existence, it would be worthwhile to recall another\nimportant aspect of the teaching. Dependent-origination functions as the\nBuddhist de\ufb01nition of the Middle path. In order to tread the middle path, one\nmust avoid the extremes of eternalism (sassata) and extinction (uccheda). The\npoint of interest for our concerns is that both the extremes represent a mis-\ntaken conception of the self. In this respect, the 12 links express the early\nBuddhist vision of the center: no Self/self exists, and the idea that the self is\ncompletely void is also mistaken. By offering the notion of mental condi-\ntioning portrayed by the 12 links, the Buddhist tradition supplies a positive\narticulation of the functioning of experience devoid of an essential gravita-\ntional center. We see again that dependent-origination is concerned with the\nworkings of subjectivity, not with existence in general.\nThere exist different de\ufb01nitions of the extreme positions of sassata and\nuccheda.31 The Brahmaja\u00afla-sutta (DN i,13) de\ufb01nes sassata as a mistaken view\nthat \u2018\u2018the self and the world are eternal,\u2019\u201932 produced by an ability to recall\npast lives in meditation or by logical analysis. Uccheda consists of the belief\nthat personal existence is completely annihilated at the end of life.33 A more\npragmatic de\ufb01nition of the extremes appears in the Acelakassapa-sutta (SN ii\n20), which believes that the idea that the one who acts (so karoti) is the same\nas the one who experiences the result of the act (so pat:isam: vedayati) is a case\nof eternalism. The idea that the two are completely distinct amounts to\n30 This point has been emphasized by Schmithausen (1997, pp. 13\u201314, 2000, pp. 43\u201344). In\nSchmithausen (1997, p. 13) he explicitly states that he believes that the theory of inter-connectedness\nof all elements was a later development, connected mainly to Hua-yen Buddhism.\n31 An important case is the oft-quoted Kacca\u00afnagotta-sutta which names the extremes atthita and\nnatthita, usually translated as \u2018existence\u2019 and \u2018non-existence\u2019. It can be shown that these terms\nrefer to sassata and uccheda, and should not be understood to imply abstract notions of existence\nand non-existence. The key to this reading is that the sutta de\ufb01nes the view atta me (\u2018\u2018my self\u2019\u2019) as\nthe root of the erroneous extremes. Bhikku Bodhi (2000, p. 734, n. 29) too believes the\nKacca\u00afnagotta-sutta to be discussing the extremes of sassata and uccheda.\n32 \u2019\u2019\u2026sassatam: atta\u00afnan\u02dcca lokan\u02dcca pan\u02dcn\u02dcapenti.\u2019\u2019 Loka (\u2018\u2018the world\u2019\u2019) here should be understood as\nthe world of experience. See Harvey (1995, p. 79), Hamilton (1996, pp. xxvi\u2013xxviii).\n33 The discussion here of the Brahmaja\u00afla-sutta is only a very rough outline of its colorful\nexpression. The sutta devotes four different views to sassata, followed by four more to ekacca-\nsassta (\u2018\u2018partial-eternalism\u2019\u2019). Many of the other views it presents deal with sassata implicitly. The\nsutta discusses Uccheda in views 51\u201357.\n310\nE. Shulman\n123",

Explains that dependent-origination was originally intended to solve the philosophical problem of selfhood by showing how experience can exist without a permanent self while still maintaining moral agency. This discussion appears within the paper's broader argument that early Buddhist dependent-origination dealt specifically with mental conditioning rather than being a general theory of causality.\nextinction. In a similar context, the Timbaruka-sutta (SN ii 23) de\ufb01nes sassata\nas the belief that feeling (vedana\u00af) and feeler (so vedayati) are one. Uccheda\nmeans that feeler and feeling are distinct.34\nThese few examples should suf\ufb01ce in order to show that the conceptual\nde\ufb01nition of the middle path in the early teachings deals with the nature of\nthe self. Sassata addresses a belief in the true existence of such a self as an\nessential entity continuous over time. Uccheda believes in the true exis-\ntence of the self as well, but thinks it will be annihilated at the end of this\nlife, or at the end of an act. It also tends toward a denial of moral\nresponsibility. Although there is much more to gain from a more com-\nprehensive analysis of the two extremes, their basic meanings are quite\nclear: they express a misunderstanding of the nature of the self. In many\ncases, the 12 links appear after the Buddha states that \u2018\u2018avoiding both\nextremes the Tatha\u00afgata teaches a doctrine abiding by the middle.\u2019\u201935 This\ntells us that dependent-origination is intended to be a solution to the\nproblem of the Self.\nThe point that the 12 links serve as a de\ufb01nition of the nature of expe-\nrience devoid of a true self is widely accepted.36 As an exposition of the\nmiddle it aims to explain experience without a self. It should be empha-\nsized that this is all that dependent-origination was initially\u2014an explanation\nof the way the mind conditions its own experience in sam: sa\u00afra. It wishes to\nexplain the middle position between self and lack of self, that are both\nincoherent according to the Buddhist view. The extremes are not concerned\nwith abstract notions of existence. What the middle path means in the\ncontext of early Buddhism, as it is articulated by the concept of pat:icca-\nsamuppa\u00afda, is that there exists no true self, but that moral agency none-\ntheless produces real results.\n34 Both these last two suttas conduct their discussion in relation to the question whether\nsuffering is caused by self or by another. The \ufb01rst implies eternalism, the second extinction.\nThe Buddha solves the apparent contradiction with the help of the 12 links. The Timbaruka-\nsutta does not say \u2018\u2018sassata\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018uccheda\u2019\u2019 explicitly, but calls both the views it expresses\n\u2018\u2018extremes\u2019\u2019 (ante). Its formulation of the extreme positions\u2014as the sameness or difference of\nvedana\u00af and so vedayati\u2014is more complex than the other de\ufb01nitions referred to, which are\nclear in de\ufb01ning sassata and uccheda in relation to the temporal continuity of the subjective\nelement. The Timbaruka-sutta continues the discussion conducted in the Acelakassapa-sutta,\nand I suggest reading its formulation in light of it. The point seems to be that understanding\n\u2018\u2018the feeler and the feeling\u2019\u2019 as either same or different demands a substantial and essential\nsubjective agent, a self. One should note the difference in the understanding of suffering as not\narising from self or other between these two suttas and Na\u00afga\u00afrjuna\u2019s Mu\u00aflamadhyamaka-ka\u00afrika\u00af\n1.1 and 12.1.\n35 Ubhe ante anupagamma majjhena tatha\u00afgato dhammam: deseti.\n36 Collins (1982, ch. 2, especially pp. 103\u2013110), Gethin (1998, pp. 140\u2013146), Gombrich (1988,\np. 63), Piyadassi Thera (1959, pp. 37\u201342), Rahula (1974 [1959], ch. 6), Ronkin (2005, pp. 194\u2013198).\nEarly Meanings of Dependent-Origination\n311\n123",

The fact that the toothache I\nsuffered from last week was impermanent is of much joy to me, and this\ndoesn\u2019t at all convince me that it had nothing to do with my self. Quite the\ncontrary, actually. But if the Self (capital S!) is de\ufb01ned as permanent bliss,\nthen this most central teaching begins to make sense. If Self means only\npermanence and joy, then the factors of the personality cannot be regarded as\nthe Self since they are associated with change and pain. Therefore the\nempirical self has no clear point of reference. This conclusion\u2014that the\nteaching of non-selfhood makes sense only in relation to the Upanis:adic\nconcept of the a\u00aftman\u2014is understood to apply also to another important\nexposition of the anatta doctrine in the Nika\u00afyas, i.e., the argument about lack\nof control over the aggregates.39\nWhen these observations regarding the anatta doctrine are joined to the\nconclusions reached in this study regarding pat:iccasamuppa\u00afda, a remarkably\nclear picture begins to emerge. The Buddha of the Nika\u00afyas teaches a doctrine\nthat is based on an analysis of the Self/self. He is seen to be an integral part of\nthe spiritual community of his day, a community in search of the deathless\nessence of subjectivity. The Buddha was unique in this religious milieu in that\nhis search for the Self discovered only mental conditioning. He reached the\n\ufb01rm conviction that such a Self is an impossibility.

Hence he \u2018\u2018taught a\nteaching abiding by the middle,\u2019\u2019 as systematized by the 12 links.\nThe Buddha appears as a seeker growing out of both the Brahmanic and\nthe ascetic traditions of his day. The unique place the Buddha occupied in the\nchanging tradition is re\ufb02ected in the doctrine of prat\u0131\u00aftya-samutpa\u00afda as it has\nbeen de\ufb01ned above. The teaching deals with the nature of subjectivity, as an\nintegral part of the search for the a\u00aftman. Denying such a subjective essence,\nthe Buddhist teaching addresses embodied mental conditioning. Nonetheless,\nthe Upanis:adic intuitions regarding the relations between the a\u00aftman and the\ncosmos are maintained in the doctrine of dependent-origination. These are the\nontological implications of prat\u0131\u00aftya-samutpa\u00afda that suggest that the objective\naspects of experience result from subjective motion.\nRecently Joanna Jurewicz (2000) has discussed the Vedic antecedents of\nthe prat\u0131\u00aftya-samutpa\u00afda doctrine. Following the lead of Gombrich (1996),\nJurewicz reads the Buddha\u2019s formulation of the doctrine as an adaptation of\nVedic cosmological theories of creation, translating them into an analysis of\n\u2018\u2018the process of human entanglement in empirical existence\u2019\u2019 (p. 79). She\nbelieves prat\u0131\u00aftya-samutpa\u00afda to be a polemic against Vedic thought, identifying\nthe cosmic creative process as a personal creation of suffering. Jurewicz goes\non to reveal the relations between the terms used by the Buddha in the 12\nlinks and their Vedic origins.\nThe analysis of prat\u0131\u00aftya-samutpa\u00afda in this paper \ufb01ts well with Jurewicz\u2019s\nreading of the doctrine, albeit with a different understanding of its onto-\nlogical purport. Again the Buddha is seen as a thinker and teacher inter-\nested mainly in subjectivity. He was part of a tradition that attempted a\nnew reading of the Vedas: translating the language of sacri\ufb01ce into the\nlanguage of meditation, and de\ufb01ning existence as a re\ufb02ection of the Self.41\n40 This point may be debated. Harvey (1995) has argued that the Nika\u00afyas do not argue against the\nempirical self. Rather, the teachings should be understood as a magni\ufb01cation of this self to the\npoint of realization. Although I do not wish to side with Harvey\u2019s view on this matter, it must be\nadmitted that this question is more complex than the one relating to the essential Self, which the\nBuddha clearly argued against.\n41 A good example of this principle is Br: hada\u00afran: yaka Upanis:ad 1.4.17: \u2018\u2018This is his completeness:\nthe mind is his self, speech his wife, breath his offspring, the eye his human wealth\u2014for he \ufb01nds it\nby his eye, the ear his divineness\u2014for he hears of it with his ear. His self is his sacri\ufb01cial action, for\nhe performs sacri\ufb01cial action with his self. This is the \ufb01vefold sacri\ufb01ce: the animal is \ufb01vefold, man\nis \ufb01vefold, all this, anything whatsoever is \ufb01vefold.

Explores how the Buddha's theory of dependent origination (prat\u012btya-samutp\u0101da) both incorporated and rejected aspects of Vedic thought, particularly regarding consciousness and subjectivity.\nThe emerging tradition believed the Self to be the deep root of existence,\nand taught that the one who understands its relation to existence gains all\nhe desires.42 The Buddha participated in the move from cosmological\nmetaphysics\nto\nsubjectivity,\nbut\ndiffered\nfrom\nhis\nfellow-seekers\nby\nregarding the Self as a painful fantasy. Knowledge of the Self, rather than\nbeing the pinnacle of human achievement, is a sure route to sam: sa\u00afric\nsuffering. He believed that what the Brahmanic r: s:is viewed as cosmic\nconnections could be better expressed in a description of human psychol-\nogy. The Buddha was both an integral part of, and a signi\ufb01cant break from\nthe Vedic-Upanis:adic spiritual tradition.43 We see in his formulation of\nprat\u0131\u00aftya-samutpa\u00afda an acceptance of the new inclination to de\ufb01ne existence\nin terms of subjectivity, together with a denial of the truth of any sub-\njective essence.\nThe Vedic meanings carried by the 12 links suggest, once again, that the\nontological implications of the Buddha\u2019s theory of dependence described\nthings as being dependent on subjectivity, not as dependent on other\nthings. In this context, conditionality means being conditioned by con-\nsciousness, not by abstract notions of the relation between cause and effect.\nThis statement can go so far as to say that the objective aspects of expe-\nrience are constituted by consciousness, conditioned by, or existing in\nrelation to subjectivity. This is a radical statement, but clearly different\nfrom the one which believes all \u2018\u2018things\u2019\u2019 to be \u2018\u2018causally conditioned.\u2019\u2019\nNote that this understanding of the signi\ufb01cance of the Vedic meanings the\n12 links are impregnated by diverges from Jurewicz\u2019s view that the Buddha\ndenied any ontological import to prat\u0131\u00aftya-samutpa\u00afda.44 Rather, as I sug-\ngested above, the early formulation of the 12 links possesses deep onto-\nlogical implications. These implications are intimately related to\u2014one could\nbetter\nsay\nconditioned\nby\u2014the\nVedic\ncosmological\nbackground\nthat\nunderlies the Buddhist formulation of the 12 links, as revealed by Jurewicz,\ntogether with the Upanis:adic notions regarding the relation between Self\nand cosmos.\n42 See the quote in the preceding footnote, and speci\ufb01cally the statement at its end, a common\nexpression of the Upanis:ads: \u2018\u2018Whoever knows this obtains all this world\u2019\u2019 (tad idam: sarvam: a\u00afpn: oti\nya evam: veda). See also, a little earlier in the text, Br: hada\u00afran: yaka Upanis:ad 1.4.17\n43 An Upanis:adic teaching more in line with Brahmanic metaphysics and very similar to the\nBuddhist principle of mental conditioning is chap. 7 of the Cha\u00afndogya Upanis:ad. In this Upanis:ad,\nmost signi\ufb01cantly in 7.26, we \ufb01nd an expression of the process by which different mental qualities\nemerge from the a\u00aftman, in a manner highly reminiscent of the Buddhist notions of mental con-\nditioning. This Upanis:ad attests to the fact that the relation between Buddhist and Brahmanic\nnotions of causality are multi-dimensional. It also supports the claim that the Buddha was both an\nintegral part of the spiritual community of his day and an innovative and revolutionary teacher. I\nthank Keren Arbel for bringing this Upanis:ad to my attention.\n44 See, for example, p. 100: \u2018\u2018The negation of the ontological nida\u00afna constitutes the Buddha\u2019s\nmaha\u00afnida\u00afna.\u2019\u2019\n314\nE.

        "page_content": "Focuses on the evolution and interpretation of the Buddhist concept of dependent-origination (prat\u012btya-samutp\u0101da) from its Vedic origins through later Buddhist developments. Examines how the original meaning centered on mental conditioning and subjectivity gradually shifted away from its Vedic resonances as Buddhism developed independently. Concludes by summarizing how dependent-origination was initially about causal mental links rather than a general principle of universal causality.\nNote that Jurewicz\u2019s interpretation of prat\u0131\u00aftya-samutpa\u00afda probably tells us\nmuch about the Buddha, but less about his disciples.45 The Vedic meanings of\nthe terms the Buddha used to describe mental conditioning may have resonated\ndeeply in the ears and hearts of his students. Two hundred years later (to pick an\narbitrary \ufb01gure), after Buddhism developed mainly within its own con\ufb01nes,\nprobably much less was left of that resonance. For the generations of Buddhist\nthat followed the Buddha, avidya\u00af, sam: ska\u00afra and upa\u00afda\u00afna contained presumably\nmainly cognitive meanings, as they do today. We can assume that the subjective\naspect of the teaching was strengthened the more it was practiced, as Buddhism\nwas de\ufb01ning its self-identity by distancing itself from Brahmanic teachings.\nConclusions\nIn conclusion I would like to sketch the basic outline of the argument. Depen-\ndent-origination was initially the sets of causal links (most familiar to us as 12),\nnothing more. More precisely it was the notion of mental conditioning these\nlinks employ. Nowhere in the Pali suttas of the major four nika\u00afyas is there found,\nto my knowledge, a passage that should cause us to think otherwise. The insight\nof dependent-origination expresses the Buddha\u2019s analysis of the dynamics of\nsubjectivity, an endeavor arising from the search for Self-knowledge, the like of\nwhich we \ufb01nd in the Upanis:ads. Dependent-origination was concerned with\nsubjectivity, but extended beyond the mental to intimations regarding the\nrelation between consciousness and the world it encounters. The understanding\nof prat\u0131\u00aftya-samutpa\u00afda popular today as a general principle of causality relating\nto all things proves to be a result of later doctrinal developments. The formu-\nlation of dependent-origination allowedthe Buddhaboth to participate in andto\ndistinguish himself from the spiritual traditions of his day.\nAcknowledgements I wish to thank the anonymous reviewer for directing me to the papers of\nCollet Cox and Joanna Jurewicz referred to above, that both greatly bene\ufb01ted this paper.\nReferences\nBodhi, B.

He suggests that these teachings express\nearlier notions of dependent-originations than the ones captured by the 12 links. It is interesting to\nnote that the terms appearing in Nakamura\u2019s discussion are of a de\ufb01nitive psychological nature,\nand can probably not be as easily integrated with Vedic notions of cosmology. Although this does\nnot effect Jurewicz\u2019s analysis, it reinforces the view that the gravitational center of the Buddha\u2019s\nteaching was human psychology.\nEarly Meanings of Dependent-Origination\n315\n123",

Presents the concept of \"dependent arising\" and cognitive awareness (vijn\u0101na) as frameworks for understanding consciousness and experience. Outlines how both traditions view cognitive processes as arising from conditions and feedback systems, shaped by linguistic classifications and unconscious mental processes.\nContemporary Buddhism, Vol. 3, No. 2, 2002 \n13 Routledge\ng ^ \nTaylorLFrancisCtoup\nThe dependent arising of a\ncognitive unconscious in\nBuddhism and science\nW. S. Waldron\nMiddlebury College, Vermont, USA\nThere is a growing consensus in Western thought and science that we may\nunderstand ourselves and our world more deeply if we think in terms of patterns\nof relationships rather than of reified essences or independent entities\u2014if we\nthink, that is, in the traditional Buddhist terms of dependent arising. This essay\nexplores some of the common ground between these two perspectives by\nfocusing upon two core Buddhist concepts, the dependent arising of our 'world\nof experience', and the notion of vijn\u0101na, 'discerning cognitive awareness' or\nsimply 'consciousness', ultimately arriving at its most important development in\nthe Yogacara school of Indian Buddhism, the alaya-vij\u00f1ana, a form of sublim-\ninal cognitive awareness or 'unconscious structuring of the world'. We will\ndraw upon ideas from such modern fields as general systems theory, evolution-\nary biology and cognitive science in order to elucidate these ancient Buddhist\nnotions, resulting in provocatively different, yet to my mind more evocatively\ncontemporary, interpretations of key Buddhist concepts. Rather than pursue a\nsimple point-by-point comparison between these traditions, however, we shall\nseek to invoke their commonalities by engaging in an inductive, almost\nphenomenological inquiry into the arising of 'the world of experience' without\nan experiencer.\nTo anticipate both the structure and argument of this essay, we will focus on\na number of areas where Indian Buddhist thought constructively converges with\ncurrent trends in scientific approaches to mind. They both focus upon patterns\nof dependent relationships rather than on actions of independent entities; within\nwhich cognitive awareness (vijn\u0101na) is understood as a process that arises by\ndepending upon conditions, rather than a faculty that operates by acting upon\nobjects. Such cognitive awareness arises as an awareness of differences within\na correlative cognitive domain, rather than as a perception of objects within a\npre-existing external world. These cognitive domains, moreover, are thought to\nhave arisen through processes of circular causality (feedback systems), which\nwere in large part brought about by those very discernments of difference. And\nsuch discernments are thought to arise, in part, through unconscious processes\npre-formed by linguistic classifications, rather than through conscious processes\nperforming rational procedures.\nThis 'linguistification' of human mental processes gives rise in turn to a\nsymbolic self, which is dependent upon the reflexive possibilities of language\nusage rather than reflective of the existence of substantive souls.

        "page_content": "Focuses on the intersection between Buddhist thought and modern scientific perspectives regarding consciousness and causality. Explores how both traditions view consciousness as arising from patterns of relationships rather than independent entities, particularly through the Buddhist concept of 'dependent arising'. Examines how this shared perspective leads to understanding consciousness and experience as processes without requiring a permanent self or experiencer.\n142 W. S. Waldron\nthe notion of a 'cognitive unconscious' epitomizes all of the aforementioned\npoints: it develops through evolutionary processes of circular causality, which\ngive rise to forms of awareness without an experiencing subject, by means of\nwhich our 'world of experience' is continuously yet unconsciously constructed,\nclassified, and mapped. This unconscious structuring of experience, both per-\nspectives submit, imparts the cogency of human experience, with its deep sense\nof subjective coherence, without relying upon essential or substantive causal\nagents, either external or internal. In this way, at least some Buddhist thinkers\nand some modern scientists have reached some accord in ways to think about\n'Thoughts without a Thinker'.\nThe 'dependent arising of the world' as phenomenology of experi-\nence\nIndian Buddhists observed that we can best understand complex causality\u2014how\nthings come to be\u2014by understanding the systemic relations in which they are\ninvolved and the patterns of dependence upon which they arise; that is, by\nunderstanding their 'dependent arising'. As we shall see, this formula subse-\nquently became the basis for a Buddhist model of circular causality wherein\ncertain specified patterns of conditions continuously feedback upon themselves,\nreinforcing their own evolutionary processes.\nThe classical Indian Buddhist conception of causality1 is singularly expressed\nin this simple formula of dependent arising:\nWhen this is, that comes to be; with the arising of this, that arises. When\nthis is not, that does not come to be; with the cessation of this, that ceases.\n(M II 32, etc.)\nOne of the most important implications of this model is that it dispenses with\nthe notion of fixed entities or unchanging essences altogether. Instead of asking\nhow independent entities act within or upon an objective world, the view of\ndependent arising asks 'under what conditions does such and such a phenom-\nenon arise?' or, more elaborately, 'what various complex conditions interact in\nwhat recurrently patterned ways in order to routinely give rise to what kind of\nphenomena?'.2\nIn other words, our attention shifts away from a concern with independent\nagents acting on independent objects, the entrenched grammatical syntax of\nconventional language,3 and towards an investigation of the complex, proces-\nsual and interactive arising of things. But this requires focusing upon patterns\nof arising rather than on agents of action\u2014and patterns are relational, not\nsubstantive, and arising is dynamic, not static.4 The Buddhist dismissal of\nselves, essences or unchanging entities, therefore, derives not so much from\nlogical propositions or first principles, such as 'all is change', as much as it\nfollows from the nature of its questions: 'how do things come to be?'\u2014a point\nthat is all the more obvious by a similar disavowal of essences,5 entities or\nsubstantive selves6 in modem science.\nDownloaded by [TOBB Ekonomi Ve Teknoloji] at 12:48 22 December 2014",

Examines how consciousness arises not as an independent agent but as a result of specific conditions coming together, particularly between sense organs and their corresponding stimuli. Describes this as neither purely subjective nor objective, but rather occurring at the interface between sensing faculty and sensed object.\nCognitive Unconscious in Buddhism and Science \n143\nThis is the conceptual framework, the causal syntax if you will, within which\nmost early Buddhist analyses of mind took place. It is an attempt to describe\nand understand experience as it arises. It is, in a word, a phenomenology of\nconsciousness.\nThe dependent arising of cognitive awareness\nThis is well exemplified in the concept of vijn\u0101na (P. vi\u00f1\u00f1ana), 'cognitive\nawareness' or 'consciousness', the central-most concept in Buddhist analysis of\nmind. Although the Buddha7 declared that in general 'Apart from conditions,\nthere is no arising of cognitive awareness' (M I 258), each specific form of\ncognitive awareness arises in conjunction with particular factors; for example,\n'Visual cognitive awareness arises dependent on the eye and (visual) form' (S\nII 73). That is, a moment of cognitive awareness {vijn\u0101na) arises\n8 when an\nobject appears in a sense field, impinging upon its respective sense organ. Sense\nobject and sense organ (or faculty) are thus correlatively defined, for a visual\nobject is, by definition, the kind of stimulus that can impinge upon an eye.\nAlthough it is common to speak of cognitive awareness as if it actively\ncognizes objects, in the syntax of dependent arising cognitive awareness does\nnot actually cognize anything\u2014it simply is the awareness that arises when the\nrequisite conditions come together.\n9 Vasubandhu, author of the fifth-century\nAbhidharma-ko\u015ba, makes precisely this point:\nThe s\u016btra teaches: 'By reason of the organ of sight and of visible matter\nthere arises the visual consciousness': there is not there either an organ\nthat sees, or visible matter that is seen; there is not there any action of\nseeing, nor any agent that sees; this is only a play of cause and effect. In\nthe light of [common] practice, one speaks, metaphorically, of this\nprocess: 'The eye sees, and the consciousness discerns.' But one should\nnot cling to these metaphors. (AKBh, Pr\u00fcden 1988, 118)\n10\nIn other words, to interpret vijn\u0101na as an act of cognition rather than an\noccurrence of awareness is to ignore the syntax of dependent arising, which\ntakes no active subject. Once again, the traditional Buddhist denial of a\nsubstantive, unchanging entity may be seen as less a metaphysical position than\na function of its mode of analysis.\n1 '\nCognition, in these terms, is thus neither purely subjective nor wholly\nobjective. Like a transaction that takes place between individuals, cognitive\nawareness occurs at the interface, the concomitance of a sense organ and its\ncorrelative stimulus. Cognitive awareness is thus neither an exact 'mirror of\nnature' that reflects things 'as they are'\u2014since what constitutes an 'object' is\nnecessarily defined by the capacities of a particular sense organ\u2014nor is it a\nunilateral projection of a priori categories\u2014since the cognitive capacities of a\nsense organ are similarly defined by the kinds of stimuli that may impinge upon\nthem.\n12 This entails a number of far-reaching implications, for discerning\ncognitive awareness is not only an event that occurs temporally, but one that\nequally depends upon relational distinctions\u2014and relational distinctions, it\nshould be clear, are hardly substances.\nDownloaded by [TOBB Ekonomi Ve Teknoloji] at 12:48 22 December 2014",

Uses Bateson's analogy of an electrical switch to illustrate how perception only exists in moments of change and differentiation. Links this understanding to the Buddhist concept of dharmas as momentary, distinctive events that have no independent existence outside their relational contexts.\n144 \nW. S. Waldron\nThe dependent arising of awareness [vijn\u0101na] of difference\nPerception operates only on difference. All receipt of information is\nnecessarily the receipt of news of difference. (Bateson 1979, 31)\nIn his popular book Mind and Nature, Bateson (1979, 120-1) compares\ncognitive processes with a simple electric switch:\nthe switch, considered as a part of an electric circuit, does not exist when\nit is in the on position. From the point of view of the circuit, it is not\ndifferent from the conducting wire which leads to it and the wire which\nleads away from it. It is merely 'more conductor'. Conversely, but\nsimilarly, when the switch is off, it does not exist from the point of view\nof the circuit. It is nothing, a gap between two conductors which\nthemselves exist only as conductors when the switch is on. In other\nwords, the switch is not except at the moments of its change of setting,\nand the concept 'switch' has thus a special relation to time. It is related\nto the notion 'change' rather than to the notion 'object'.\nThe switch exists, as a switch, only at the moment of switching; otherwise it\nremains indistinguishable from the rest of the circuit. Our sense organs function\nsimilarly, Bateson avers: they only operate relative to, that is, are only triggered\nby, changes in stimuli, by events. Bateson is not simply parroting the ancient\nplatitude that 'everything changes'.\n13 Rather, he is suggesting the more funda-\nmental notion that change is constitutive of perception itself. Hence, to even\nspeak of perception is necessarily to speak of events\u2014and this is to speak in\nterms of dependent arising.\nMoreover, just as the switch does not exist, for the circuit, except while the\nswitch is switching, so too distinct stimuli do not exist, for a cognitive system,\nexcept insofar as they also involve contextual differences. An absolutely\nisolated or absolutely camouflaged object would be imperceptible. This is not\nto say that 'differences are perceived' (which would abandon the syntax of\ndependent arising), but rather that such differences are constitutive of perception\nin the same way that change is. To even speak of perception, therefore, is\nnecessarily to speak of contextual differences. Awareness of differences, how-\never, does not arise outside of a context, since differences only occur between\nphenomena. Contextual differences, in other words, have no singular location.\nAs Bateson (1979, 109) observes: 'Difference, being of the nature of relation-\nship, is not located in time or in space'. Since differences arise contextually\nrather than independently, and are episodic rather than enduring, they have no\nsubstantive existence. Not being substances, they neither come nor go any-\nwhere.\nThese ideas suggest an interesting approach to the elusive notion of dharma\nin Abhidharma thought.

Abhidharma, in other\nwords, is a 'metapsychology', which self-consciously 'deals with the various\nconcepts and categories of consciousness as the primary objects of investiga-\ntion' (Piatigorsky 1984, 8). Thus, while dharmas may ultimately refer to\nexperiential phenomena, what counts as a dharma in any system of description\nmust always be distinguished from other dharmas.

Since such distinctions are\nconstitutive of cognitive awareness, the classifications they depend upon are\nalso indispensable for the arising of any moment of discerning cognitive\nawareness (vijn\u0101na).

We\ncategorize as we do because we have the brains and bodies we have and\nbecause we interact in the world the way we do ...

Examines how cognitive awareness and physical structures continuously influence and modify each other through feedback processes, both at micro and macro evolutionary scales. Explores how this reciprocal relationship between organisms and their environments leads to the co-evolution of cognitive domains and perceived worlds, aligning with both Buddhist philosophy and contemporary biological theory.\n146 W. S. Waldron\nphy has much in common with scientific models of causality, particularly those\nof cognitive science and evolutionary biology.\nStimuli are always impinging upon the sense organs, giving rise to forms of\ncognitive awareness, however subtle; and these processes continuously but\nsubtly modulate the structures of these organs, which in turn influences their\nreceptivity to subsequent stimuli.19 These two processes\u2014that living itself\nentails continuous moments of cognitive awareness and that cognitive aware-\nness entails continuous modification of living structure\u2014illustrate the reciprocal\ncausal relation between the structure of sense organs and the arising of\ncognitive awareness. These reciprocal processes, however, not only occur at the\nmicro level of cognition, but also at the macro level of evolution. Both\nevolutionary biology and the view of dependent arising also articulate models\nof circular causality in order to describe how things come into being over\nthe long term through the recursive, accumulative processes of feedback\ncausality.20\nThis implies, in the biological view, that the very minds and bodies we\nembody today reflect the gradually accumulated results of reproductively\nsuccessful interactions between our forebears and their natural and social\nenvironments. As with our analysis of cognitive awareness, evolutionary theory\nhere shifts our attention from the arising of entities to the recurrent patterns of\ninteraction. 'What evolves', biological philosophers Maturana and V\u00e1rela\nobserve, 'is always a unit of interactions' (1980, 12), neither the organism by\nitself, and certainly not the environment alone, but rather the organism-in-\nenvironment. In other words, it is patterns of interaction that evolve,21 repre-\nsenting for each species an 'evolution of [its] cognitive domains'.22 And,\nsimilarly and reciprocally, the evolution of its cognitive domain is the evolution\nof the 'world'\u2014for that kind of organism\u2014a process Maturana and V\u00e1rela call\na 'structural coupling with the world'.\nWhat constitutes the 'world' or 'environment' for any given organism,\ntherefore, depends upon these evolved cognitive structures. We cannot speak of\nan independent, objective world that organisms have access to, because 'the\ndomain of classes of interactions into which an organism can enter constitute its\nentire cognitive reality' (Maturana and V\u00e1rela 1980, lOf; emphasis added). To\neven speak of a 'world', therefore, is necessarily to speak of a cognizing, that\nis, an interacting, organism. In this sense, and consonant with the view of\ndependent arising, 'world and perceiver specify each other' (V\u00e1rela et al. 1991,\n172)\u2014both synchronically, from moment to moment, as well as diachronically,\nover the life and lifetimes of individuals and species.\nCircular causality brings forth a world: Buddhism\nWe may now more fully appreciate some of the implications of the formula of\ndependent \narising, \nwhose \ncyclic \nnature \nwarranted \nthe \nappellation\nsamsara, literally 'the going around'.

For as long as the cognitive processes give rise to\nsensation (spar\u015ba) and feeling (vedana), then craving (t\u0157sna) and grasping\n(upad\u0101na) will tend to arise, which in turn tend to elicit the intentional\nafflicted activities, the karma, that ultimately shape and sustain the structures\n(samsk\u0101ra) that perpetuate further existence\u2014all of which constitutes the\n'arising of the world' (S II 73).\n23 And for as long as these structures\npersist, they provide the conditions that both enable and conduce to\nfurther cognitive and afflictive processes, and so on. This model of circular\ncausality\u2014enabling structures that give rise to cognitive awareness, which in\nturn elicit the afflictions that instigate actions which reinforce those very\nstructures, and so on\u2014is, we submit, the core of the non-Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist\nworld view.\n24\nEvolutionary biology and Buddhist thought thus both analyze the causal\nrelations underlying momentary cognitive processes and long-term evolutionary\nprocesses in a similar fashion:\n25 the 'arising of the world' for an individual, its\nontogeny, as well as, for a species, its phytogeny,\n26 can be equally well\nunderstood as the evolution of specific cognitive domains out of the dynamic\nvortex of cyclic causality.\nSince the recurrent interactions between cognitive awareness and its enabling\nstructures, which entail continuous modification of these structures, are causally\neffective at either a developmental or evolutionary scale, it follows that the\nparticular implicit and innate classificatory systems that condition cognitive\nawareness themselves become important factors in the further development of\nliving structures (samsk\u0101ra); that is, they impart causal influences upon human\nevolution in their own right. Living forms have, in effect, 'enstructured' their\ncognitive maps, their capacities for cognitive discernment, through the extended\nepigenetic processes of circular causality. This is true at the individual level, in\nour neural pathways, for example, as well as at the species level, as in\nevolutionary theory.\nBut classifications, we remember, refer to patterns of relationships not\nproperties of substances, to maps not territory. That is to say, the distinctions\nthat constitute our cognitive schemas\u2014which have no spatial location and come\nfrom nowhere and go nowhere\u2014are indispensable conditions for the dependent\narising of our minds and bodies. In Buddhist terms, the dharmas that give rise\nto discerning cognitive awareness are constitutive conditions for 'the arising of\nthe world' not just epistemologically, which is obvious, but ontologically as\nwell. In other words, there would be no distinctively human embodiment\nwithout the classifications and categorizations constitutive of the arising of\ncognitive awareness itself.\nAnd what is our most important source of human categorization and\nclassification, whose distinctions have no spatial location either inside or\noutside of our brains,\n27 and is, furthermore, one of the most salient features of\nour physical and mental structures?

Explores the parallels between Buddhist concepts of dependent arising and modern scientific understanding of how language and symbolic thinking became intrinsic to human consciousness. Examines how both perspectives view language as creating recursive feedback cycles that structure human perception and experience.\n148 \nW. S. Waldron\nCognitive awareness arising from consensual communication\nOur linguistic capabilities did not, of course, spring fully formed from the head\nof Zeus. They too resulted from the accumulative, constructive and circular\nprocesses of evolution whereby cognitive processes condition living structures,\nwhich in turn condition further cognitive processes, and so on.28 As linguistic,\nsymbolic communication 'dependently arose' in early hominids it became a\npowerful evolutionary force in its own right, radically and irrevocably changing\nthe structures and processes of the human brain.29 This momentous change\ncentered on an increasingly enlarging prefrontal cortex, where such symbolizing\nprocesses apparently occur.30 As language use and 'prefrontalization' mutually\nreinforced each other, the symbolic-linguistic mode of cognition that depends\nupon them came to dominate other, originally non-linguistic, processes. In other\nwords, human cognitive processes, even simple sensory ones, unavoidably arise\nin dependence upon our 'linguistified' brain. Language, then, along with the\nsystemic distinctions that constitute it, is not something added on to human\ncognitive processes. Systemic symbolic thinking is constitutive of normal\nhuman cognitive processes.31\nThis prefrontalization of human cognition, however, is fraught with unin-\ntended consequences, consequences that follow from the very nature of\nlinguistic symbolification: language gives rise to its own feedback cycles. Not\nonly can we not 'help but see the world in symbolic categorical terms',\naccording to neurophysiologist Deacon (1997, 416), 'dividing it up according to\nopposed features, and organizing our lives according to themes and narratives.'\nBut, he ominously notes, '[Symbolically mediated models of things ... exhibit\ncomplicated nonlinearity and recursive structure as well as nearly infinite\nflexibility and capacity for novelty due to their combinatorial nature' (Deacon\n1997, 434). This linguistification of human cognitive processes, in other words,\nrepresents a physiologically enstructured, predominating cognitive strategy\ncharacterized by compulsive yet creative recursivity, based upon words that are\ndefined disjunctively and systemically, not independently or substantively, and\nwhose meanings are merely conventionally determined. No wonder Deacon\nambivalently observes (1997, 436): 'we are not just a species that uses symbols.\nThe symbolic universe has ensnared us in an inescapable web'.32\nBuddhist analysis of mind also connects reflexivity, and the linguistic\ncategorizations it depends upon, with cognitive processes (yij\u00f1ana) that have\nbeen built up through the accumulating, epigenetic cycles of dependent arising.\nIn this view, cognitive reflexivity and recursivity also depend upon the recipro-\ncal relationships between sensory cognitive awareness, non-sensory (symbolic)\nobjects such as thoughts or ideas,, and the ensnaring web of conceptual\nproliferation (S. prapa\u00f1ca, P. papa\u00f1ca) entailed by language use:\nDependent on the eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises.

Examines the Buddhist view that the notion of \"I am\" perpetuates cycles of conceptual proliferation and mental constructs. Discusses how this sense of self emerges from symbolic representation and becomes embedded in unconscious cognitive processes, leading to the Yogacara school's distinction between supraliminal (conscious) and subliminal (unconscious) awareness.\nCognitive Unconscious in Buddhism and Science 149\ntinged by mental proliferation [papa\u00f1ca-sa\u00f1\u00f1a-sankha] beset a man with\nrespect to past, future, and present forms cognizable through the eye ...\nmind-objects cognizable through the mind. (M I 11 If) (N\u0101\u0146amoli 1995,\n203)\n33\nThe most deeply entrenched locus of these recursive possibilities, which also\ndoubles back to instigate its own linguistically generated recursivity, is no doubt\nour sense of self as an enduring, experiencing agent. As one P\u0101li text declares,\n'the notion \"I am\" is a proliferation; \"I am this\" is a proliferation; \"I shall be\"\nis a proliferation' (S IV 202f). The very thought \u038a am' is, according to the\nSutta-nip\u0101ta, the root (m\u00fala) of proliferation itself.34 In short, as long as the\nthought \u038a am' persists, so long will endless cycles of apperceptions, conceptual\nproliferation and further apperceptions, and so on, keep spinning.\nThis sense of self, however, derives its compelling cogency, its enduring and\nendearing allure,\n35 from the same social and linguistic matrix that other words\nand symbols do: symbolic representation.\n36 Like language, this symbolic self is\na product of massive interdependency; like other relational phenomenon, it has\nno substantive existence in time or space. 'It is a final irony', Deacon concludes:\nthat it is the virtual, not actual, reference that symbols provide, which\ngives rise to this experience of self. The most undeniably real experience\nis a virtual reality ... its virtual nature notwithstanding, it is the symbolic\nrealm of consciousness that we most identify with and from which our\nsense of agency and self-control originate. (1997, 452; original emphasis)\nThe cognitive unconscious as embodied structuring of experience\nLanguage and the symbolic self that language enables are also both complex\nproducts of interdependent processes that have, like habits, become enstructured\ninto our underlying physiological and psychological structures. As Deacon\nobserves (1997, 456), 'It is the goal of most cognitive processes to make\ninformation processing unconscious and automatic\u2014as quick, easy, and\nefficient as possible'. We may distinguish, therefore, between the immediate but\nintermittent processes of discerning cognitive awareness accompanied by atten-\ntion, and the underlying but continuous processes operating automatically.

Describes the reciprocal relationship between conscious and unconscious cognitive processes, highlighting how language and self-conception become deeply embedded in unconscious mental structures.\n150 W. S. Waldron\nsubsumed under the term alaya-vij\u00f1ana (roughly 'store-house' consciousness).37\nThis Buddhist 'cognitive unconscious,' however, is no more an experiencer,\nagent or enduring subject than was cognitive awareness in the earlier model. It\npreserves all the qualities and qualifications mentioned earlier: 'it is related to\nthe notion \"change\" rather than to the notion \"object\" ... admitting] only news\nof difference' (Bateson 1979, 121), it evolves through the accumulating,\nepigenetic processes of cyclic causality, and it gives rise to cognitive domains\nwhich constitute a specific cognitive reality, a dependently arisen 'world of\nexperience'. According to the Samdhinirmocana S\u016btra, this form of subliminal\ncognitive awareness is such that:\nthe mind with all the seeds (i.e., the alaya-vij\u00f1ana) matures, congeals,\ngrows, develops, and increases38 based upon the two-fold substratum39\n(or: appropriation, upad\u0101na); that is, (1) the substratum of the material\nsense-faculties along with their supports (sadhisthana-rupendriya-\nup\u0101d\u0101na), (2) and the substratum which consists of the predispositions\ntoward conceptual proliferation in terms of conventional usage of images,\nnames, and conceptualizations.\n40\nThat is, subliminal cognitive awareness (alaya-vij\u00f1ana) continuously arises in\nconjunction with (1) the living sense-faculties, and (2) the predispositions\ninstilled by past linguistic experience, conceptualization, naming, and so on,\ndefining as its specific cognitive domain an 'external world' which, however,\nremains outside of immediate awareness.41 We live, that is, in a 'world' whose\npredominant structuring influences\u2014linguistic and physiological structures built\nup over time through extended organism-environment interaction\u2014we cannot\nfully discern. And this is, if I am not mistaken, nearly exactly the current notion\nof the 'cognitive unconscious' (Lakoff and Johnson 1999, 9-15).\nThis model provides a way of articulating the continuous, simultaneous and\nmutually reinforcing relationship that occurs between subliminal and supralim-\ninal cognitive processes in all ordinary human activities. On the one hand, all\nsupraliminal cognitive processes are said to arise simultaneously with and based\nupon subliminal cognitive awareness (alaya-vij\u00f1ana),42 which is itself continu-\nously and simultaneously informed by the classifications constituting the\npredispositions (v\u0101san\u0101) toward conceptual proliferation, etc. On the other\nhand, the arising of supraliminal cognitive awareness also continuously entails\nmodulations or transformations of the forms of unconscious cognitive aware-\nness themselves, implanting 'seeds' (b\u012bja) or impressions (v\u0101san\u0101) as the texts\nsay.\n43 These reciprocally reinforcing and gradually accumulating processes take\nplace not only simultaneously, ceaselessly and mostly automatically, but also,\nin large part, unconsciously.\nSince linguistic categories and classifications underlie all forms of cognitive\nawareness, subliminal as well as supraliminal, then they too are susceptible to\nthe same conceptual prolixity, the same ensnaring recursivity that all language\nentails, which is now understood to occur at unconscious levels as well.\nConcurrently, our sense of self\u2014enabled by and arising out of the reflexivity of\nlinguistic representation\u2014is also seen to have become so deeply enstructured\nDownloaded by [TOBB Ekonomi Ve Teknoloji] at 12:48 22 December 2014",

The symbolic self, in other words,\nalthough generated out of the vortex of the linguistic recursivity underlying all\ncognitive processes, from the unconscious on up, has effected compelling causal\nefficacy in its own right.45 And this is true both within a single lifetime, that is,\nontogenetically, as well as in the traditional Buddhist conception of multiple\nlifetimes, that is, (after a fashion) phylogenetically.\nThe cognitive unconscious as generative matrix of our 'common\nworld'\nWe live our lives in this shared virtual world... The doorway into this\nvirtual world was opened to us alone by the evolution of language.\n(Deacon 1997, 22)\nHow is it that our experience collectively gives rise to our shared world of\nexperience? We live in this 'shared virtual world', as Deacon puts it, in large\npart because 'the evolution of symbolic communication ... created a mode of\nextrabiological inheritance ... [that] is intrinsically social' (1997, 409f), one that\nevolved 'neither inside nor outside brains, but at the interface where cultural\nevolutionary processes affect biological evolutionary processes' (Deacon 1997,\n409f).

As the commentary to\nMahayana-samgraha (MSg 1.60), explains:\n[The statement:] 'The common [characteristic of the alaya-vij\u00f1ana] is the\nseed of the receptacle-world' means that it is the cause (k\u0101ra\u0146a-hetu) of\nperceptions (vij\u00f1apti) which appear as the receptacle world.

Examines how linguistic recursivity and unconscious mental processes shape our collective understanding of the world through feedback systems. Explores how these shared symbolic structures bridge individual and collective experience, connecting personal karma with shared worldviews in both Buddhist philosophy and contemporary neuroscience.\n152 \nW. S. Waldron\n'common aspects' of the alaya-vij\u00f1ana give rise to a 'common' receptacle\nworld. As a medium for sharing, conceiving and expressing experience, lan-\nguage provides the stimulus for similar kinds of cognitive processes to arise,\nprocesses that tend to provoke similar responses,47 which, in turn, typically give\nrise to similar results. That is, actions that are informed and instigated by similar\nconditions and similar intentions give rise, over the long term, to a similar\n'world'.\nAnd it is because our cognitive structures depend upon linguistic predis-\npositions that cognitive awareness is always subject to language's endless\nrecursivity (prapa\u00f1ca). The 'predispositions or impressions of speech'\n(abhil\u0101pa-v\u0101san\u0101)\u2014which are said to have the 'special power' (s\u0101kti-visesa) of\nconventional expressions (vyavahara) to give rise to cognitive awareness\n(vijn\u0101na) in regard to expressions of selves (\u0101tmari), dharmas, and actions, and\nso on\n48 (ad MSg 1.58)\u2014are never fully 'used up' (anupabhukta), MSg 1.61.2\nexplains, because 'the seeds of the impressions of language give rise to\nconceptual proliferation since beginningless time'. In other words, linguistic\nrecursivity is the generative matrix from which endlessly springs forth the\ncontents of our shared symbolic world, one that virtually supersedes the\nphysical world we apparently inhabit.\nThe reciprocal feedback processes within which language is entwined thus\noperate on a variety of levels, not only synchronically\u2014between the alaya-\nvij\u00f1ana and supraliminal forms of cognitive awareness\u2014but also diachroni-\ncally, between our previous linguistic experience and our present proclivities\nconditioned by the 'impressions' of language. These operate both within a\nsingle lifetime and, in traditional Buddhist terms, over multiple lifetimes. But\nthere is also a third, unconscious yet thoroughly intersubjective, feedback\nsystem, which, like the other two, continuously proliferates and perpetuates\nsamsaric existence, but which, unlike them, bridges the individual and collec-\ntive experience of the 'world', connecting our similar karmie activities with the\nsimilar 'worlds' these activities bring about.49\nOur shared world, then, dependent upon our shared species-specific cognitive\nstructures, is ultimately inseparable from our shared cognitive awareness,\ndependent upon our shared linguistic, symbolic structures. As Deacon declares:\na person's symbolic experience of consciousness ... is not within the\nhead ... This [symbolic] self is indeed not bounded within a mind or\nbody ... [it] is intersubjective in the most thoroughgoing sense of the\nterm. (1997, 452f)\nIt is our common but unconscious habits of body, speech, and mind to which\nwe are habituated that give rise, in the long term and in the aggregate, to the\nhabitats we collectively inhabit. And, this, we suggest, is as true for some\ntwentieth-century biologists and neuroscientists, as it was for fifth-century\nYogacarin Buddhists.\nSuch perspectives serve to both clarify the nature of our alienation and\nbondage\u2014our enchantment (there is no better word) with reified abstractions,\nsuch as genes, neurons, species, or selves\u2014as well as to suggest paths beyond\nDownloaded by [TOBB Ekonomi Ve Teknoloji] at 12:48 22 December 2014",

Emphasizes a shift away from viewing humans as autonomous agents toward understanding them as intersubjective beings embedded in patterns of relationships.

For once we start thinking of organisms as complex dynamic\norganizations interacting in patterned relationships with their environments, our\nolder, ultimately alienating, models of human beings as autonomous agents\nunilaterally acting on, or passively being acted upon, an independent, external\nand pre-existing world becomes limited at best and misleading at worst. The\nconstructive power of these models comes not only from the idea that we can\nunderstand living processes better by understanding the patterns of interaction\nthrough which they arise, that is, their 'dependent arising', but also from the\nnotion that we are collectively responsible for the world we continuously\nconstruct together. For if we are not really trapped inside our heads, but are\ncausally as well as cognitively intersubjective through and through, then it\nmatters indeed which particular concepts, categories and classifications we\nproduce, proclaim and protect.\nNotes\nThe author gratefully acknowledges permission to reproduce parts of 'Buddhist Steps to\nan Ecology of Mind: Thinking about \"Thoughts without a Thinker\" ' (Eastern Buddhist,\n2002, XXXIV, 1-51), from which this article is largely drawn.\n1 This is, unavoidably, a generalization. There were numerous sects that often differed\nin their interpretations of dependent arising.\n2 There are many passage in the P\u0101li texts such as the following: 'Who, now, Lord,\nis it who craves?'. 'Not a fit question', said the Exalted One. \"I am not saying\n[someone] craves. If I were saying so, the question would be a fit one. But I am not\nsaying so. And I not saying so, if you were to ask thus: 'Conditioned now by what,\nlord, is craving?' this were a fit question. And the fit answer there would be:\n'Conditioned by feeling is craving.' \" (S II 13).\n3 'All our forms of speech are taken from ordinary, physical language and cannot be\nused in epistemology or phenomenology without casting a distorting light on their\nobjects' (Wittgenstein Philosophical Remarks, \u00a757; cited in Stern 1995, 12).\n4 Since by definition essences do not change, they can have no obvious causal effect\nin the world of change; an unmoving billiard ball does cause another ball to move,\nonly a moving one does. Essences are therefore metaphysical notions unrelated to the\nendeavor to understand causality in the phenomenal world. In slightly different\nterms, Wittgenstein (Philosophical Investigations, \u00a7271) suggests that 'a wheel that\ncan be turned though nothing else moves with it, is not part of the mechanism'.\n5 Gombrich (1996, If) cites Karl Popper's remarks on the non-essentialism and\nnominalism of modern science: 'Popper, 1952, vol. II, p. 14): \"the scientific view of\nthe definition \u0386 puppy is a young dog' would be that it is an answer to the question\n'What shall we call a young dog?' rather than an answer to the question 'What is a\npuppy?' (Questions like 'What is life?' or 'What is gravity?' do not play any role in\nscience.) The scientific use of definitions ... may be called its nominalist interpret-\nation, as opposed to its Aristotelian or essentialist interpretation. In modern science,\nonly nominalist definitions occur, that is to say, shorthand symbols or labels are\nintroduced in order to cut a long story short.\" Popper 1974:20: \"... essentialism is\nmistaken in suggesting that definitions can add to our knowledge of facts ...\" '.",

Waldron\nway that we normally conceptualize our inner lives is inconsistent with what we\nknow scientifically about the nature of mind. In our system for conceptualizing our\ninner lives, there is always a Subject that is the locus of reason and that metaphor-\nically has an existence independent of the body. As we have seen, this contradicts\nthe fundamental findings of cognitive science'.\n7 There are serious historical questions concerning whether or to what extent the\ndiscourses preserved in the P\u0101li Canon represent the actual words of the Buddha. As\nthese questions do not directly affect the import of this paper, we follow their\ntraditional attribution to the Buddha.\n8 M I 190: 'When internally the eye is intact and external forms come into its range\nand there is the corresponding engagement, then there is the manifestation of the\ncorresponding class of consciousness' (\u00d1\u0101namoli 1995, 284).\n9 As Rahula (1959, 23) points out, 'Consciousness does not recognize an object. It is\nonly a sort of awareness \u2014 awareness of the presence of an object'. Milinda's\nQuestions: 'Because there are vision here and material shape, sire, visual conscious-\nness arises. Co-nascent with that are sensory impingement, feeling, perception,\nvolition, one-pointedness, the life-principle, attention-thus these things are produced\nfrom a condition and no experiencer is got at here' (Miln., 78).\n10 Buddhaghosa similarly states in the Visuddhimagga (XIX, 20): 'He sees no doer over\nand above the doing, no experiencer of the result over and above the occurrence of\nthe result. But he sees clearly with right understanding that the wise say \"doer\" when\nthere is doing and \"experiencer\" when there is experiencing simply as a mode of\ncommon usage'.\n11 Wittgenstein's attempt to forge a subjectless language entailed similar consequences:\n'It is because a language designed for the sole function of expressing everything that\na subject might experience has no need for a term designating that subject that one\ncannot refer to the subject of experience from within the phenomenological lan-\nguage... From within, one cannot individuate a subject at all. The metaphysical\nsubject is not an object of experience, but a way of indicating the overall structure\nof experience ... The grammar of the phenomenological language ensures that all\nstatements about experience are expressed in the same\u2014ownerless\u2014way' (Stern\n1995, 84).\n12 'Color concepts are \"interactional\"; they arise from the interactions of our bodies, our\nbrains, the reflective properties of objects, and electromagnetic radiation. Colors are\nnot objective; there is in the grass or the sky no greenness or blueness independent\nof retinas, color cones, neural circuitry, and brains. Nor are colors purely subjective;\nthey are neither a figment of our imaginations nor spontaneous creations of our\nbrains ... Rather, color is a function of the world and our biology interacting' (Lakoff\nand Johnson 1999, 24-5).\n13 In his Philosophical Remarks \u00a754, Wittgenstein (1975) makes the following remark:\n'What belongs to the essence of the world cannot be expressed by language. For this\nreason, it cannot say that all is in flux. Language can only say those things we can\nalso imagine otherwise'.

Draws parallels between Buddhist ideas of causality and modern scientific understanding of evolutionary biology and systems theory. Explores how both perspectives view change and development as emerging from circular, reciprocal relationships rather than linear cause-and-effect.\nCognitive Unconscious in Buddhism and Science \n155\n15 From the root verb 'dhr' to hold, bear, carry, maintain, preserve, keep, possess, use,\nplace, fix, etc.'. Derived meanings of dharma are 'that which is established or firm,\nsteadfast, law, statute, prescribed conduct, duty, right, justice, virtue, morality,\nreligion, etc.'(SED, 510, 519). In the Abhidharma context, it is traditionally defined\nas that which 'holds' (dh\u0101rana) its own mark (AKBh ad I.2b; Shastri, 12; Poussin,\n4: svalaksan\u0101dh\u0101ran\u0101d dharma).\n16 This is arguably implicit in the perspective of dependent arising from the beginning:\n'He who with right understanding sees the arising of the world as it really is, cannot\nattribute non-existence to the world; he who with right insight sees the passing away\nof the world as it really is, cannot attribute existence to the world' (S II 17).\n17 Since dharmas are themselves dependency arisen events, they are expressed in terms\nof patterns of relationship (with the concomitance of X and \u03a5, \u0396 arises). But because\nthe multiple conditions for the arising of a phenomenon were themselves dharmas (X\nand Y), the formula of dependent arising was fairly early on implicitly, or perhaps\nincipiently, a system wherein the sense of each item was mutually and disjunctively\ndefined. That is, Buddhists fairly quickly came to recognize that they were working\nwith systems of relationships rather than with terms individually defined.\n18 Varela et al. make a similar point: 'The visual system is never simply presented with\npregiven objects. On the contrary, the determination of what and where an object is,\nas well as its surface boundaries, texture, and relative orientation (and hence the\noverall context of color as a perceived attribute), is a complex process that the visual\nsystem must continually achieve ... In the words of P. Gouras and E.

It is, rather, linear\nlogic that is the problem: 'How is the world of logic, which eschews \"circular\nargument\", related to a world in which circular trains of causation are the rule rather\nthan the exception? ... we shall see that logic is precisely unable to deal with\nrecursive circuits without generating paradox and that quantities are precisely not the\nstuff of complex communicating systems. In other words, logic and quantity turn out\nto be inappropriate devices for describing organisms and their interactions and\ninternal organizations' (Bateson 1979, 21).\n21 'Evolutionary stable strategies within and between populations, whether or not they\nculminate in symbiogenesis, require that the \"unit of selection\" now ceases to be an\nindividual genotype or even phenotype, and becomes instead a relationship between\ngenotypes and/or phenotypes' (Rose 1997, 229-30; original emphasis).\n22 'What evolves is always a unit of interactions defined by the way in which it",

See Waldron (2000).\n26 Varela et al. (1991, 121) interpret these two aspects of dependent arising as roughly\ncorresponding to phylogeny and ontogeny: 'we could say that such traces (kanna) are\none's experiential ontogeny ... Here ontogeny is understood not as a series of\ntransitions from one state to another but as a process of becoming that is conditioned\nby past structures, while maintaining structural integrity from moment to moment.\nOn an even larger scale, karma also expresses phylogeny, for it conditions experience\nthrough the accumulated and collective history of our species'. One of the main\ndifferences with evolutionary theory, however, is that Indian Buddhists see the\n'evolution' of mind is terms of the continuity of individual mind-strearns from one\nlifetime to the next, with karma as the basic causal mechanism whereby changes are\ntransmitted from one life to the next. In Darwinian thinking, this role is played by\nnatural selection. In this sense, Buddhist ideas are akin to a form of Lamarkianism.\n27 See Deacon (1997, 4090 P- 151 this article.\n28 As Capra (1998, 220) points out, 'as it keeps interacting with its environment, a\nliving organism will undergo a sequence of structural changes ...an organism's\nstructure at any point in its development is a record of its previous structural changes\nand... each structural change influences the organism's future behavior'.\n29 'It is simply not possible', Deacon concludes (1997, 409f), 'to understand human\nanatomy, human neurobiology, or human psychology without recognizing that they\nhave all been shaped by something that could best be described as an idea: the idea\nof symbolic reference'.\n30 '[S]ymbol use itself must have been the prime mover for the prefrontalization of the\nbrain in hominid evolution'(Deacon, 1997, 336).\n31 'As our central nervous system \u2014 and most particularly its crowning curse and\nglory, the neocortex \u2014 grew up in great part in interaction with culture, it is\nincapable of directing our behaviour or organizing our experience without the\nguidance provided by systems of significant symbols ...

Provides key definitions from Buddhist commentaries explaining how multiple causes give rise to multiple effects in a cyclic pattern. Establishes the foundational terminology and cycles used to describe dependent arising in Buddhist texts.\nPiya Tan    \n \n \nSD 5.16 Dependent arising \n \nhttp://dharmafarer.org  \n107 \nDependent Arising \nPa\u1e6dicca samupp\u0101da1 \nby Piya Tan \u00a92003 \n \nIn the ignorance that implies impression that knits knowledge that finds the nameform \nthat whets the wits that convey contacts that sweeten sensation that drives desire that adheres  \nto the attachment that dogs death that bitches birth that entails the ensuance of existentiality. \n(James Joyce, Finnegans Wake, NY: Viking Press, 1967:18) \n \n0 Preamble \n \n0.1 SUMMARY OF TERMS2 [1]  \n \n0.1.1 Definition \n \n \n0.1.1.1  Dependent arising is essentially an account of the causal nature of the cycle of existence \n(va\u1e6d\u1e6da), showing the conditions that hold together the wheel of birth and death, and make it turn from \none existence to another. It shows how all existential conditions arise, not singly, but as a meeting of \ncauses that bring about a set of effects\u2014and that there is no first cause or prime mover: it is all cyclic. \nAnd it is a cycle that can be broken, when we know where the weak links are. \n \n \n0.1.1.2  The Commentaries define dependent arising as the arising of effects evenly in dependence \non a meeting of conditions (paccaya,s\u0101maggi\u1e41 pa\u1e6dicca sama\u1e41 gantv\u0101 phal\u0101na\u1e41 upp\u0101do).3 This implies \nthat no single cause can produce a single effect, nor does only one effect arise from a single cause. \nRather, there is always a set of causes giving rise to a set of effects. \n \nIn the well-known 12-link formula [diagram 3.3], when one cause is stated as conditioning the fol-\nlowing effect, this is merely to single out the chief condition among a set of conditions, and relate it to \nthe most important effect among a set of effects.4 \n \n0.1.2 Key terms \n \n \nThe various occurrences of the full dependent arising formula can be summarized as falling into the \nfollowing cycles: \n \npa\u1e6dicca,samupp\u0101da \n dependent arising; refers to the \u201cnormal\u201d (anuloma) or forward or direct \ncycle: \u201cwith the arising of ignorance \u2026 \u201c5 \n \n1 I gratefully thank all those who have helped in the proof-reading of this paper.

It \nserves as a reminder of where we stand on the path of awakening, or it should remind us that we (the \nunawakened) have yet to awaken to the liberating truth. However, from the way that some write and \nspeak of Buddhism \u2014from the young Buddhist to the specialist scholar, ordained or lay\u2014it appears as if \nthey have found awakening. That is to say, they think that their notion of Buddhist doctrine is right, and \nthe only right one. \nIt is important to understand that as long as we are not yet awakened, whatever we say\u2014rightly or \nwrongly\u2014can be just that, an opinion. It may be helpful\u2014and should be\u2014but still it is a provisional view. \nOnly the awakened mind, having experienced true reality and understood it, sees and speaks that liberat-\ning truth.  We may understand such a teaching, but we still need to practise and realize it for ourself. \nOnly when we are ourself fully awakened can we truly know whether or not another is awakened. \nOtherwise, we are merely projecting our self-views and hopes. A false view can be a greater spiritual \nhindrance than not knowing but seeking an answer. We may have to set free our past social and relig-\nious conditionings, our pains and fears, and our present biases and limitations (including the language \nwe are using)10\u2014at least forget them momentarily\u2014as we face the Dharma, like meeting an old friend, \nso that we can fully see and understand it. Then, the learning and healing process begins. \n \n0.3  My point is that as students of the Buddha Dharma, we should always respect an opinion\u2014take it for \nwhat it is\u2014whether it is ours or another\u2019s. Our learning at this point can at best be third-hand (through \nreading and listening) or second-hand (through personal reflection). Only the fully awakened has first-\nhand knowledge. Unless we are fully awakened saints, we should not act as if we have first-hand wisdom \nand offer eternal truths or final judgements.  \nOur opinions condition us, we condition our opinions. If we cling to opinions without a greater curio-\nsity, then we will surely be caught in a loop of self-delusion. We will be left far behind as other inquiring \nand investigative minds seek and see better answers to the basic questions of life. If we examine our \nlives and their moments, we will notice we have been letting go of views after views. Consequently, life \nand learning become clearer, which helps us to be more mentally focused and well directed in our lives.",

Introduces the foundational concepts and terminology of dependent arising by explaining its relationship to the Four Noble Truths and breaking down the etymology of the Pali term pa\u1e6dicca,samupp\u0101da. Sets up the framework for understanding dependent arising as both a philosophical and practical teaching that explains the nature of suffering and its cessation.\nPiya Tan    \n \n \nSD 5.16 Dependent arising \n \nhttp://dharmafarer.org  \n109 \n0.4  As seekers, we should regard every occasion for hearing and knowing the Dharma as an opportunity \nfor straightening out and focusing our views thus far. This is not to say that everyone is wrong, or that \neveryone is right either, but that our wisdom grows through understanding that we have yet to awaken, \nand to that extent we are wiser, and much more able to take the next step with compassion, mindful-\nness and eagerness to learn.11 \nThe teaching of dependent arising is a fertile field for strong opinions and what appears to be contra-\ndicting views even amongst serious practitioners and teachers of Buddhism. This is not a debate arena \nwhere right is might or right is might, but where seekers need to examine the connections amongst these \ndiffering opinions\u2014and to search the suttas and texts for insights\u2014to see beyond the words of the mas-\nters. It behooves us then to seek self-understanding.12 \n  \n1 Terminology \n \n1.1 THE 4 NOBLE TRUTHS \n \n1.1.1 The 4 noble truths, said to be \u201cthe teaching peculiar to Buddhas\u201d (buddh\u0101na samukka\u1e41sika desan\u0101, \nM 1:380), are as follows: \n \n(1) the noble truth that is suffering (dukkha), \n(2) the noble truth that is the arising of suffering (dukkha,samudaya), \n(3) the noble truth that is the ending of suffering (dukkha,nirodha), and \n(4) the noble truth that is the way leading to the ending of suffering (dukkha,nirodha,gamin\u012b pa\u1e6dipad\u0101). \n \n1.1.2 The 1st noble truth is a general statement of the universality and nature of unsatisfactoriness. The \n2nd and the 3rd truths are, respectively, the prognosis and the cure, while the 4th is the prescription, how \nthe medication is to be applied. The two middle truths \u201care actually telescoped versions of a longer form-\nulation that discloses the origin and ending of bondage in sa\u1e41s\u0101ra\u201d (M:\u00d1B 30), which in its full form is \ncalled \u201cdependent arising\u201d (pa\u1e6dicca samupp\u0101da).13  \n \n1.1.3 When elaborated, the second noble truth\u2014the arising of suffering (samudaya)\u2014expresses itself as \nthe normal (anuloma) cycle of dependent arising [4]. The third noble truth\u2014the ending of suffering [18]\u2014\non the other hand, is a succinct expression of the reverse (pa\u1e6diloma) cycle of dependent ending [19.3.2]. \n \n1.2 PA\u1e6cICCA,SAMUPP\u0100DA  \n \n1.2.1 The Pali term, pa\u1e6dicca,samupp\u0101da, is a compound resolved as pa\u1e6dicca (because of) + sam,upp\u0101da \n(\u201ccom-,\u201d together + arising).

Examines detailed etymological explanations from the Visuddhimagga commentary, including how the term reflects the interdependent nature of causation. Addresses the historical context through Jurewicz's analysis of how the Buddha skillfully used Vedic terminology to explain dependent arising without a soul concept.\nSD 5.16 \n \n \n            Dependent arising \nhttp://dharmafarer.org  \n110 \nmeans \u201carising together.\u201d As such, pa\u1e6dicca,samupp\u0101da is sometimes rendered as \u201cdependent co-arising\u201d \nor \u201cconditioned co-production.\u201d  \n \n1.2.2 Other translations of the term are \u201cconditioned genesis,\u201d \u201cinterdependent arising,\u201d \u201cdependent \norigination\u201d and \u201cdependent arising.\u201d The last translation is preferable as it is broad enough to encom-\npass all the applications of the term pa\u1e6dicca,samupp\u0101da, as reflected in the Visuddhi,magga\u2019s colourful \netymologies: \n \n \n \n16.  This word pa\u1e6dicca,samupp\u0101da that is the totality of states (dhamma,samuh\u0101) arising \nfrom conditionality (paccayat\u0101) is to be regarded in two ways.

In simple terms, this is the expressions of the will to live\u2014that is, craving and ignorance func-\ntioning as greed, hate and delusion\u2014that taint our actions and reactions.21 \n(3) Consciousness (vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a) comprises 6 classes, that is, eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, \nnose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness and mind-consciousness. These are the \nsources of our knowledge, as well as the mental world that we create for ourselves and inhabit. Our \n\u201cknowledge\u201d is mostly a hodge-podge of what we see as desirable, or what endorses our views, or \nconditions that shape and drive us without our ever knowing them. At best, what we think we really \nknow is only provisional, shaped by the past, projected into the future, and simply letting the present \nslip by unnoticed.22 \n(4) Name-and-form (n\u0101ma,r\u016bpa). Name comprises feeling, perception, volition, contact and attention. \nForm is the 4 elements and their derived elements.23 \u201cName\u201d comprises the manner by which we recog-\nnize and identify whatever we \u201csense\u201d of form, that is, our physical nature and the world out there. These \nare the tags and images we actually work with in our mind and making sense of ourself and of others. We \nimagine how things should be, and take that to be true reality\u2014a world we have created in our own \nimage.24 \n(5) The 6 sense-bases (sa\u1e37-\u0101yatana) are the eye-base, the ear-base, the nose-base, the tongue-base, \nthe body-base and the mind-base. These are our only sources of knowledge. There are actually our \nidenti-kit with which we construct images of our experience of ourself and of others, that is, images of \nshapes and hues, sounds, smells, tastes, touches and thoughts. We fail again and again to recognize that \nwe never really experience the \u201cexternal\u201d world, but construct our internal images of them, with which \nwe identify, interact and proliferate.25 \n (6) Contact (phassa) is of 6 classes, that is, eye-contact, ear-contact, nose-contact, tongue-contact, \nbody-contact and mind-contact. This is the result of the meeting of our sense-faculties with their re-\nspective sense-objects and attention. Simply, this is how we actually \u201csense\u201d an experience.26 In the \n \n18 On dependent conditionality and the meaning and purpose of life, see SD 1.1 (4.0). \n19 Functionally, ignorance and craving pervade and control the rebirth-consciousness (bhav\u2019a\u1e45ga) or the subcon-\nscious, which, in turn, feeds our latent tendencies (anusaya) or the unconscious, which, in turn, feeds the mental \nformations (sa\u1e45kh\u0101r\u0101), the 2nd link, that is, the preconscious that lurks as greed, hate and delusion immediately be-\nhind our every deliberate action. Both the preconscious and the unconscious expresses themselves and are in turn",

Examines whether there are truly 12 distinct links or only 11, since the last link (decay-and-death) connects back to ignorance to complete the cycle. Explores the technical term paccay'\u0101k\u0101ra (\"dependent mode\") and how the links work in both forward and reverse sequences.\nSD 5.16 \n \n \n            Dependent arising \nhttp://dharmafarer.org  \n112 \nDas\u2019uttara Sutta (D 34), S\u0101riputta teaches that \u201cthe one thing to be fully understood\u201d (eko dhammo \npari\u00f1\u00f1eyyo) is \u201ccontact accompanied by the influxes that is the basis for clinging\u201d (phasso s\u00e2savo up\u0101d\u0101-\nn\u012byo).27 This suggests that this is one of weak (even the weakest) link where the whole cycle can be \nbroken. \n(7) Feeling (vedan\u0101) is of 6 classes, that is, feelings born of eye-contact, ear-contact, nose-contact, \ntongue-contact, body-contact and mind-contact. This is our evaluation of the experience arising from \nour respective sense-contacts. This is the unconscious activity of measuring our experiences, and \ncomparing them\u2014liking whar we see as pleasurable, rejecting what we see as not, and ignoring what we \nhave no feeling for\u2014over time (past, future and present).28 \n \n(8) Craving (ta\u1e47h\u0101) is of 6 kinds, that is, craving for sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches and mind-\nobjects. This is when we \u201cvalue-add\u201d our sense-experiences, deciding which to retain and replicate, \nwhich to reject and destroy, and which to ignore or tire of.29 \n(9) Clinging (up\u0101d\u0101na) is of 4 kinds, that is, clinging to sensual pleasures, to views, to rituals and \nvows, and to the self-doctrine. While craving runs after what is desirable, pushes away what is undesir-\nable, and ignore what is neutral, clinging grasps what it sees as desirable, and it takes the shape and \nform of what it grasps.30 \n \n(10) Existence (bhava) refers to states of being of the sense-sphere, the form sphere and the fornless \nsphere. We live in the sense-sphere; hence, we are created by by our sense-pleasures, challenged by \nwhat we see as threatening our pleasures, never finding satisfaction in our pleasures (on account of \nignorance and craving).31 \n(11) Birth (j\u0101ti) means descent into the womb, then the arising of the aggregates and the shaping of \nthe sense-bases. This is the natural continuation of our mental energies, fed by our existence, which \ncontinues to shape our future, so that we are caught in the rut of repeating ourselves.32 \n(12) Decay-and-death (jar\u0101,mara\u1e47a). Here, decay refers to the bodily decay, decline of vitality and \ndegeneration of the faculties. Death is the passing away of all kinds of beings, the break-up of the aggre-\ngates, and the ending of the life-span. The very fact that we exist means that we\u2014our body and mind\u2014\nare subject to change. Our body is an assemblage of the 4 elements, and therefore is subject of disinte-\ngration (we have a shelf-life). Our mind, which is non-physical, \u201cperpetuates\u201d itself by way of our memo-\nries and habits constantly fed by the latent tendencies.33 \n \n1.4.2 The links\u201412 or 11? \n \n1.4.2.1  We usually speak of the \u201c12 links\u201d although there seems to be only 11 \u201clinks\u201d (nid\u0101na) since the \n12th \u201cfactor\u201d is seen only as a result. But the 12th link (decay-and-death) connects back to ignorance, and \nthe cycle repeats over and over in a single life-time. Suffering, too, arises conditioned by ignorance \nthrough craving. Hence, it is known as the \u201c12-link cycle\u201d (dv\u0101,dasa paccay\u2019\u0101k\u0101ra).  \n \n1.4.2.2  Paccay\u2019\u0101k\u0101ra literally means \u201cdependent mode.\u201d The 12 factors are links also in the sense that \nthe \u201creverse\u201d (pa\u1e6diloma) series [0.1.2], works backwards to show how the last (decay-and-death, etc) is \n \n27 D 34,1.2(3)/3:272.

Explores how conditions can be either sufficient (must produce an effect) or necessary (required for an effect), using examples like fire and heat. Examines how specific conditionality expresses relationships between phenomena through their behavior and activities rather than through fixed essences or entities.\nSD 5.16 \n \n \n            Dependent arising \nhttp://dharmafarer.org  \n114 \nThe first pair of line shows the sufficient condition, that is, a cause that must always produce the \neffect (that is, A therefore B), for example, a fire must cause heat. The last pair of lines shows the neces-\nsary condition, that is, a cause without which there would be no effect, for example, fuel is a necessary \ncondition for a fire. These two terms38 will be discussed further in section [6]. \n \n2.3.2  Idap,paccayat\u0101 is a compound resolved as ida\u1e41 + paccayat\u0101.

Their \u201creality\u201d or \u201csubstance\u201d depends on that of \nentities other than themselves, entities whose reality or substance in turn depends on entities \nother than themselves. Contingency asserts the reality of things to be their lack of independent \nor separate reality; their substance to be their lack of independent or separate substance.

To say because x arises, y arises, and because x ceases, y ceases, is to \nassert causality, which implies change over time. However, the causation of entities is not being \nasserted, because the notion of independence and separate entities has already been denied in \nthe opening. Causation occurs, but no entities are caused. \nIdappaccayat\u0101 expresses the nature of phenomena in terms of its relationship with other \nphenomena. It does not deal with the essence of a phenomenon [which, after all, does not \nexist], but with its movements, its activity; or rather, it sees the essence of any given thing to be \nits behaviour. We are what we do, identity is activity. Idappaccayat\u0101 describes a dynamic model \nof reality, a model of things as processes. The pattern of this process, the behaviour of phenom-\nena, is expressed in our next term [pa\u1e6dicca,samupp\u0101da].   \n(Kearney, 2002a:3 digital ed, amplified) \n \n \n2.3.3  Specific conditionality is the simplest expression of dependent arising.

However, most modern teachers and scholars either \nreject this teaching41 or avoid it altogether. Payutto makes a sobering note: \n \nThis point needs to be reiterated, because modern day study of the teaching (at least in tradi-\ntional scholastic circles) interprets it completely on a lifetime-to-lifetime basis.

The Vibha\u1e45ga Commentary is likewise divided into two sections, and their difference is de-\nscribed thus: \n \n \nThe Master, who has unobstructed knowledge regarding all states, has thus shown in the Sutt-\nanta Bh\u0101jan\u012bya by way of numerous moments of consciousness \u2026 , but because this interde-\npendence (paccay\u2019\u0101k\u0101ra) exists only in numerous thought-moments but also in a single thought-\nmoment \u2026 he now seeks to explain interdependence as it occurs in a single moment by means \nof the Abhidhamma Bh\u0101jan\u012bya.   \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n            \n(VbhA 199 f) \n \n3.1.3  Regarding causality functioning in one thought-moment in daily life, the Vibha\u1e45ga Commentary \nsays, for example, \u201c \u2026 because these are the birth, etc, of the formless states (ar\u016bpa), therefore, \u2018growing \nold, the falling apart of the teeth, the graying of hair, the wrinkling of the skin, the decline of vitality, the \ndegeneration of the faculties\u2019 are not mentioned.\u201d (VbhA 208).

A sufficient condition is a cause that must always produce the effect\u2014this is \nsufficient condition for that if and only if \u201cthis is by itself enough to guarantee that.\u201d72 For example, a fire \nis a sufficient condition for heat. A fire must cause heat.

The \nnecessary condition is expressed by the second half of idap,paccayat\u0101 formula:  \n \nimasmi\u1e41 asati ida\u1e41 na hoti | imassa nirodh\u0101 ida\u1e41 nirujjhati \n \nwhen this is not, that is not; | with the ending of this, that ends.74    (S 12.21/2:28) \n \n \n \nIn order to demonstrate the difference between these two types of causes I will use the \nexample just given. Fuel is a necessary condition for fire, because with the ceasing of fuel, the \nfire ceases. But fuel is not a sufficient condition for fire, because fuel doesn\u2019t always produce \nfire\u2014some fuel remain unlit. Fire is a sufficient condition for heat, because fire must cause heat, \nbecause without fire there can still be heat\u2014heat can be generated from other sources. \n \n \nSo a necessary condition is a cause without which there would be no effect, and it is ex-\npressed by the second half of Idappaccayat\u0101.

Existence (bhava) leads to birth.75 Most importantly, birth (j\u0101ti) must pro-\nduce suffering (dukkha). Therefore, the only escape from suffering is to cease from being reborn.

Volitional formations (sa\u1e45kh\u0101r\u0101) are not a sufficient condition for consciousness (vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a), or \nmore specifically, rebirth-linking consciousness (pa\u1e6disandhi.citta) and the stream of consciousness that \nfollows.  \n \n \nThis is because, having produced many rebirth-inclining kamma formations [sa\u1e45kh\u0101r\u0101] early \non in one\u2019s life, it is possible to make them all null and void (called \u2018ahosi kamma\u2019) with the \nattainment of Arahant[hood], which attainment eliminates the stream of consciousness that \nwould otherwise begin at rebirth. \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n(Brahmava\u1e41so 2003b:64) \n \n7.2  Similarly, clinging (up\u0101d\u0101na) is not a sufficient condition for existence (bhava). Through the cultiva-\ntion of the noble eightfold path, no new clinging is generated and all previous clinging no more becomes \nthe ground for generating a new existence.

Explains how dependent arising occurs over three lifetimes according to Buddhist commentators Buddhaghosa and N\u0101g\u00e2rjuna, describing how ignorance leads to volitional actions and subsequent rebirth consciousness.\nPiya Tan    \n \n \nSD 5.16 Dependent arising \n \nhttp://dharmafarer.org  \n127 \n7.3  It is also important to note here the fact that feeling (vedan\u0101) exists because of past karma. How-\never, the quality of such feeling\u2014whether it is pleasant, or painful, or neutral\u2014is not always due to past \nkarma. This is clearly stated in such suttas as the Titth\u2019\u0101yatana Sutta (A 3.61)77 and the Deva,daha Sutta \n(M 101).78 In other words, it is important to make a distinction between the fact of feeling and the quali-\nty of feeling\u2014feeling as experience, and how we evaluate it.. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8 The wheel of life \n \n8.1 CYCLIC TIME.

Bud-\ndhism, however, views life as a circle or cycle, and life, reflected as such, is repeated over and over as an \nendless continuum. Just as time has no beginning and no apparent end, so to dependent with neither \nbeginning nor end\u2014unless we fully understand it and thereby transcend it. \n \nIt should be noted that each of the factors of dependent arising is conditioned (pa\u1e6dicca.samuppanna) \nas well as conditioning (pa\u1e6dicca.samupp\u0101da). They are all relative, interdependent or interconnected, not \nsomething absolute; none of them exists in itself. Hence, no first cause is accepted by Buddhism.

However, for some Buddhist teachers and writers argue that all this is at best theoretical since the \nonly reality we can deal with is the present. The Thai Buddhist monk and reformist philosopher, Buddha-\nd\u0101sa (1906-1963), vehemently rejects this diachronic view of dependent arising, charging that it introduces \nthe notion of an enduring self and eternalism:85 \n \n \n \nExplaining dependent origination as spanning three births is wrong because it is not in accord \nwith the original Pali of the Buddha\u2019s sayings and the Suttas, because it introduces the incorrect \nnotion of self or atman, which is eternalism, and because, most harmfully, it is of no benefit or \nuse to anyone. \n \n \nExplaining dependent origination as spanning three births is of no use at all because it cannot \nbe practised when the cause is in that birth and the result is in this birth. How can the situation \nbe corrected? When the cause in this birth gives forth a result in a future birth, how can it be of \nany use to anyone, except those who are eternalists who can only dream about practice?  \n \n \nMoreover, the three births explanation is not something that can be seen by oneself, is not \nwithout delay and is not something that can be directly experienced by oneself, and so it must be \ntaken to be incorrect. It is of no use at all\u2014it can\u2019t be practised because it introduces the eternal-\nist concepts of a soul or a self\u2014so let\u2019s be finished with such an explanation. Let\u2019s return to the \noriginal Pali, which is correct in letter and spirit.  \n \n \n \n   (1992:77; also see 1986:49) \n \n \n9.2  A similar stand is taken by the English Theravada monk, \u00d1\u0101\u1e47av\u012bra (1920-1965),86 who rejects the \nthree-life dependent arising since it cannot be seen or realized now. In his \u201cA note on Pa\u1e6diccasamupp\u0101da,\u201d \nhe says, \u201cIt is a matter of one\u2019s fundamental attitude to one\u2019s own existence\u2014is there, or is there not, a \npresent problem or, rather, anxiety that can only be resolved in the present?\u201d (1987:21 \u00a77 digital ed).87 \nInterestingly, such a view reflects an annihilationist tendency popular with agnostic and materialist Buddh-\nists, and with modernists who oftem measure Buddhism against science and other religions. \n \n10 Pro three-life dependent arising \n \n10.1  In a paper published in the Buddhist Studies Review, Bodhi88 gives an important and comprehensive \nresponse to \u00d1\u0101\u1e47av\u012bra\u2019s \u201cNote.\u201d The paper should be read in full: only the two main points of Bodhi\u2019s con-\nclusion will be mentioned here. Bodhi quotes the B\u0101la,pa\u1e47\uf0b6ita Sutta (S 12.19), \u201ca terse and equally tricky \ntext\u2014that confirms the three-life interpretation of [the pa\u1e6dicca,samupp\u0101da] almost as explicitly as one \nmight wish.\u201d (1998.20/p22).

The \nformula is regarded, rather, as an expository device spread over three lives in order to demon-\nstrate the self-sustaining internal dynamics of sa\u1e41s\u0101ric becoming. The situation defined by the \nformula is in actuality not a simple linear sequence, but a more complex process by which ignor-\nance,  and clinging in unison generate renewed becoming in a direction determined by the sa\u1e45-\nkh\u0101ra, the kammically potent volitional activity. Any new existence begins with the simultaneous \narising of vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a and n\u0101ma,r\u016bpa, culminating in birth, the full manifestation of the five aggre-\ngates.

See \u00a79n ad loc. \n95 See \u00a79n ad loc. \n96 Cf Titth\u2019\u0101yatana S (A 3.61) where the Buddha declares: \u201cBased on the 6 elements, there is descent into the \nwomb; | (On account of) such a descent, there is name-and-form; | With name-and-form as condition, there is \ncontact; | With contact as condition, there is feeling. | Now, it is for one who feels that I make known [the 4 noble \ntruths]\u201d (A 3.61,9/1:176).

Thus, \nfeeling is said in the Titth\u2019\u0101yatana Sutta to be caused by the first consciousness arising in this life, whose \nown cause can only be found in a previous life.  \n \nAs such, the Titth\u2019\u0101yatana Sutta, far from supporting the idea that dependent arising does not span \nmore than one life, actually clearly proves the opposite! The fact that feeling exists at all is due to ignor-\nance (avijj\u0101) and volitional formations (sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra) from the previous life, and dependent arising, as \ntaught by the Buddha, does indeed span more than one life.97 \n \n \n10.6  In the Mah\u0101 Ta\u1e47h\u0101,sa\u1e45khaya Sutta (M 38), when what the monk S\u0101ti wrongly thinks that \u201cit is this \nsame consciousness, not another, that runs and wanders through the rounds of births.\u201d98 In other words, \nS\u0101ti believes in some kind of eternal soul, such as that taught in the Upani\u1e63ads.99 The Buddha reminds \nS\u0101ti that \u201cconsciousness is dependently arisen\u201d (pa\u1e6dicca,samuppanna\u1e41 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a\u1e41).100 Clearly here, this \ntruth applies both to our present life, and also our next life and subsequent ones (if we remain unawak-\nened). Interestingly, the latitude in interpreting this point allows those Buddhists who reject karma and \nrebirth to view dependent arising as occurring only within this life, or even as a momentary event. \n \n10.7  The B\u0101lena Pa\u1e47\u1e0dita Sutta (S 12.19) is an important sutta which attests to the truth of the 3-life \ndependent arising. The Sutta relates how the past causes of the ignorance and craving bring both the \nfoolish and the wise into present existence. The present results are the conscious body, name-and-form, \nthe 6 sense-bases, contact and feeling, that is, the being of body-and-mind that we are right now. These \nare the ignorance and craving that the foolish clings to and does not abandon. The future results consist \nof birth, decay and death, to which the foolish are again subject in a renewed existence. The wise under-\nstands the nature of these links, and so frees himself from birth and suffering.101 \n \n10.8 WHERE DOES CONSCIOUSNESS COME FROM?  While other religions attempt to give imaginative answers \nto the origin of man and his mind, the Buddha refuses to answer this unanswerable question\u2014one \nwhich even science today is unable to answer.102 However, we can at least tease out a philosophical \nanswer from the dependent-arising formula\u2014ignorance (avijj\u0101). Pragmatically, this is the best answer \nwe can ever have to the question of the origin of consciouosness.  \nPhilosophically, we may surmise that there are two possible answers to the question: Where does \nconsciousness come from? One possible answer is that it comes from God. If we are free to question \n \nthe psychological process of sensory perception.\u201d (Bucknell 1999: 327): see Madhu,pi\u1e47\uf0b6ika S (M 18,16-18/1:111-\n113).

If we persist in putting God in our equation, while denying or proscribing all its attend-\nant problems and nonsense, then we have theology and religion. We are then in the clutches of blind \nmen who claim to have found that non-existent black cat in a pitch-black room.103 \nThe second possible answer is to simply and honestly admit the truth: We don\u2019t know.  This is a valid \nanswer, because ignorance is the first link in the chain of dependent arising. According to the Buddha, \nconsciousness arises dependent on conditions, beginning with ignorance. When this idea is applied as \ndependent arising, we understand how suffering arises; when applied to dependent ending, we see the \nending of suffering. As far as the meaning and purpose of life go, this is surely the best and most liberat-\ning answer we can find or need.104 \n \n11 Seeing dependent arising in this life \n \n11.1  Although dependent arising can explain birth over 3 lives, we can also see one or two of the 12 links \nat a time. We cannot see all the 12 links at one and the same moment simply because they do not all occur \nat the same time, in one moment. It is easier to understand its operation in parts, for example, in the pre-\nsent life (especially links 3-100), that is, as \u201crebirth cycle\u201d and \u201ckarma cycle.\u201d \n \nWith this basic understanding, we can go on to contemplate how the past \u201ckarma cycle\u201d contribute to \nits operation in this life. Then, we go on to apply this understanding to see how all this condition the future \n\u201crebirth cycle.\u201d \n \nHence, it is possible to see the workings of the whole process of dependent arising in the past, present \nand future in this life itself. For this reason, dependent arising is said to be \u201cseen for oneself\u201d (sandi\u1e6d\u1e6dhika) \nand \u201ctime-free (nothing to do with time)\u201d (ak\u0101lika),105 two common epithets of the Buddha Dharma (for \nexample, the Ve\u1e37u,dv\u0101reyya Sutta, S 55.7).106  \n \n \n11.2  One of the clearest definitions of sandi\u1e6d\u1e6dhika is found in the Mah\u0101 Dukkha-k,khandha Sutta (M 13), \nwhere the dangers of sensual pleasures are shown by seven examples of consequences to be experi- \nenced \u201cin this life\u201d (sandi\u1e6d\u1e6dhika) (M 13).107 Then, in the very next paragraph, the painful consequences are \nsaid to be experienced \u201cafter death\u201d (sampar\u0101yika). Hence, sandi\u1e6d\u1e6dhika and sampar\u0101yika are antonyms.108 \n \n \nYou can also see in this life the causality that links each pair of neighbouring factors. Through \nthe development of penetrating insight empowered by tranquil meditation, you can see in this \nlife how feeling (vedan\u0101) gives rise to craving (ta\u1e47h\u0101). You can similarly witness how craving \ngives rise to clinging/fuel (up\u0101d\u0101na). And you can likewise understand in this life how craving \nand clinging/fuel produces existence (bhava) and birth (j\u0101ti) in the next life.  \n(Brahmava\u1e41so 2003b:61 f) \n \n \n103 See SD 40a,8 (4.1.1). \n104 On the meaning and purpose of life relating to dependent conditionality and the 4 truths, see SD 1.1 (4.0). \n105 On these 2 virtues of the Dharma, see Dhamm\u00e2nussati, SD 15.9 (1.2.1).

We can also observe these processes in others. But \nthe answer is not out there\u2014we can never really know what\u2019s out there even if we have all the measure-\nments of the external realities. The answer is right here within us\u2014in our own body-mind. \n \n12 The middle way \n \n12.1  The central importance of dependent arising is that it is the middle way traversing beyond the ex-\ntremes of existence and non-existence, as stated in the Mah\u0101 Kacc\u0101(ya)na,gotta Sutta: \n \n \nThis world, Kacc\u0101na, for the most part, depends on a duality\u2014upon the notion of existence and \nthe notion of non-existence.110 But for one who sees the origin of the world as it really is with \nright wisdom, there is no notion of non-existence with regard to the world. And for one who sees \nthe ending of the world as it really is with right wisdom, there is no notion of existence in regard \nto the world.111   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n (S 12.15/2:17 qu at S 22.90/3:134 f) \n \n12.2  Our daily life, from the moment we wake up, is ruled by a computer-like series of 1\u2019s and 0\u2019s\u2014the \nones representing things we want to do and the zeroes those that we rather not do\u2014and we are often \ntorn between the two, so that by the day\u2019s end, we find that we are really nowhere; that is, if we take the \ntime and wisdom to examine our life. Understandably, such an existence is cyclic and meaningless because \nwe have unwittingly surrendered our inner goodness to the mood swings between one-upmanship and \nanxiety, or in spiritual terms, between covetousness (abhijjh\u0101) and aversion (domanassa).112 \n \n12.3  On a deeper existential level, we tend to have a very narrow notion of existence and non-existence. We \noften hold the simplistic notion that \u201cI\u201d exist simply because \u201cI\u201d am here, and we cling to our experience of \nourselves as something physical, substantial and self-centred: \u201cI think, therefore I am,\u201d113 as Descartes puts \nit, which by the very same argument, means that the \u201cI\u201d is just as impermanent and unpredictable as our \nthoughts. \n \n \n109 M 12,32-43/1:73-77 (SD 49.1). \n110 See S:B 734 n29. \n111 See S:B 735 n30. \n112 These two represent the first two hindrances (n\u012bvara\u1e47\u0101) to mental focus.

Explains how these cycles can be understood both across multiple lifetimes and within a single human lifetime.\nSD 5.16 \n \n            Dependent arising                             \n \nhttp://dharmafarer.org \n \n137 \n12.4  Holding on to such an enduring notion of self, we then fear that we may not, after all, be real, or \nworse, we would be annihilated after death.114 On the other hand, as in the case of the materialist, we \nhope for self-annihilation at death, and hence we are absolved of all the bad that we have done, as it were. \nIn reality, man\u2019s greatest fear is dukkha, the intrinsic unsatisfactoriness of the world. This is, in fact, life\u2019s \nvery first truth\u2014this is what the Buddha realizes for himself. And the way out of this duality of existence \nand annihilation is the \u201cmiddle way\u201d. \n \n12.5  In popular Buddhism, we often link \u201cthe middle way\u201d to the noble rightfold path.115 R Gethin notes \nthat \u201cThis \u2018middle\u2019 would seem to be rather more significant for the subsequent development of Buddh-\nist thought than the specific notion of the ariyo a\u1e6d\u1e6dha\u1e45giko maggo as the middle way between sensual \nindulgence and self-torment\u201d (Gethin 2001:200 f).  \n \nA K Warder points out that this is best exemplified in N\u0101g\u00e2rjuna\u2019s M\u016bla,madhyamaka K\u0101rik\u0101, where \ndependent arising appears to represent the \u201cmiddle way\u201d par excellence.116 In fact, and in distinction to \nthis, the most frequently quoted and most important canonical text quoted by N\u0101g\u00e2rjuna is the Nid\u0101na \nSa\u1e41yutta (book 12 of the Sa\u1e41yutta Nik\u0101ya), especially the Kacc\u0101na,gotta Sutta (S 12.15).117 \n \n13 Cycles within the Wheel \n \n 13.1  Both Buddhaghosa and N\u0101g\u00e2rjuna [8.2] agree on the division of dependent arising into three rounds \nor cycles (va\u1e6d\u1e6da)118 [8]. The first is the \u201cdefilement cycle\u201d (kilesa.va\u1e6d\u1e6da) comprising of ignorance, craving and \nclinging. This cycle is the basis for personality-belief (sakk\u0101ya,di\u1e6d\u1e6dhi) and spiritual doubt (vicikicch\u0101). In relat-\nion to the sense worlds, this means the desire for sense-pleasures (that is, attachment to visual objects, \nsounds, etc). In the higher realms, it refers to attachment to form existence and to formless existence. \n \n13.2  The \u201ckarma cycle\u201d (kamma,va\u1e6d\u1e6da) comprises volitional formations and existence (here known as \nkamma,bhava). This cycle refers to the willful activities involving the ten unwholesome courses of con-\nduct119 and the ten bases of meritorious actions.120 In the higher realms, it refers to wholesome actions \nleading to and performed in the form worlds and the formless worlds. \n \n13.3  The \u201ckarmic-result cycle\u201d (vip\u0101ka,va\u1e6d\u1e6da) comprises consciousness, name-and-form, the 6 senses, \ncontact and feeling. This cycle refers to the resultant aggregates (khandha) in the sense-world, the form \nworld and the formless world.  \n \n13.4  The cycle can be applied synchronically, that is, to a single life-time of a human being. In this case, \nthe 12 links are systematically divided up into sets of three. Thus, ignorance, volitional formations and \n \n114 The ideas of self-protection and self-preservation are psychologically deep-rooted in humans. For self-protect-\nion, man creates God, on whom he depends for his own safety and security, just as a child depends on its parents. \nFor self-preservation, man invents the immortal soul.

And the fourth triad is made of existence, birth, and decay-\nand-death, which form the \u201cmental being\u201d (citta,vajra), representing one\u2019s senility with serious conflicts. \n(Guenther, Tibet Buddhism in Western Perspective, Dharma, 1977:103 ff.) \n \n14 A history of the Wheel of Life \n \n14.1  The earliest reference to dependent arising as a wheel or a circle is that by Buddhaghosa in his works, \nthe Visuddhi,magga and the Vibhanga Commentary, where he speaks of a wheel of rebirths (sa\u1e41s\u0101ra,cak-\nka, Vism 163 165) and of a wheel of existence (bhava,cakka).121 Buddhaghosa compares the links of the \nwheel of life to a blind man and his predicament. (1) A blind man (2) stumbles and (3) falls. His fall results in \n(4) a wound (5) that festers and (6) hurts resulting in (7) pain. The person (8) longs for a cure, and (9) gets \nthe wrong ointment which he (10) applies and (11) causes a change to the wound which (12) bursts as a \nresult. (Vism 582 f; VbhA 196).  \n \n14.2  The Sarv\u0101sti,v\u0101da (\u201cAll Exist\u201d school) regards all causes and effects of the wheel as identical.  Buddh-\nist philosophers like N\u0101g\u00e2rjuna and \u0100ryadeva interpret this law as the pure relativity of the Middle Way \n(madhyama,pratip\u0101da), identical with emptiness (\uf0a7\u016bnyat\u0101) (M\u0101dhyama.k\u0101rik\u0101 14.1-6). \n   \nThe Vij\u00f1\u0101na,v\u0101da (\u201cConsciousness Only\u201d school) sometimes takes this law to mean the process of the \nmanifestation of all phenomena out of the fundamental \u201cStore\u201d Consciousness (\u0101laya,vij\u00f1\u0101na). The Hua-\nyen (Avata\u1e41saka) school of China or Kegon school of Japan interprets dependent arising as the interpene-\ntration of all things in the universe throughout the past, present and future, asserting that nothing can \nexist by itself, and that all things are interrelated and interdependent. \n \nIn the Mah\u0101y\u0101na texts, dependent arising first found artistic expression in the form of a wheel in chap-\nter 21 (sahas\uf099dgat\u00e2vad\u0101na) of the Divy\u00e2vad\u0101na (a Mah\u0101y\u0101na life of the Buddha). According to a Mah\u0101-\ny\u0101na tradition, the Buddha gave instructions for the drawing of the wheel as a result of Mah\u0101 Maudgalya-\ny\u0101na\u2019s psychic journeys into the various realms and returning with reports regarding how the deceased \nhad fared according to their karma. The wheel was to act as a visual aid to and reminder of the true nature \nof existence. The Tibetan Tanjur (\u201cTranslated Treatises\u201d), however, attributes the painting of the first such \ndrawings to N\u0101g\u00e2rjuna (bsTan-hgyur, go 32; quoted by Lama Govinda, 1960:245n).  \n \n14.3  According to the Mah\u0101y\u0101na tradition, the Buddha is said to have instructed that a 5-spoked wheel \n(representing the 5 courses, pa\u00f1ca,gati)\u2014the devas, asuras, human, animals, pretas, and hell-beings \u2014be \ndrawn over the gateway of the Bamboo Grove outside R\u0101jag\uf0a8ha.

These represent our \nfive physical senses and the mind (the door), together constituting the six senses (sa\u1e37\u0101yatana). \n \n(6) Two lovers locked in a passionate embrace representing the contact (phassa) between the sense-\nfaculties and their external sense-objects. \n \n(7) A man with an arrow stuck in his right eye, screaming out in pain. The older version shows both \nhis eyes pierced.

However, not all teachers and scholars teachers share this \nview, even amongst the more orthodox ones.

Often I have heard some sug-\ngest that rebirth can be avoided through using sati (mindfulness) on vedan\u0101 to stop it generat-\ning ta\u1e47h\u0101 and the following factors of Pa\u1e6dicca-samupp\u0101da. This is, in my understanding, mis-\nconceived on two grounds. \n \nFirst, the \u201cforward\u201d order of Pa\u1e6dicca-samupp\u0101da was never intended to demonstrate how \nthe process should be \u201ccut.\u201d The \u201cforward\u201d order is only meant to show how the process conti-\nnues. The teaching on how the process is \u201ccut,\u201d or rather ceases, is the purpose reserved for \nthe \u201creverse\u201d order of Pa\u1e6dicca-samupp\u0101da or \u201cDependent cessation.\u201d \n \n \nSecondly, even though vedan\u0101 does not inevitably produce ta\u1e47h\u0101, because it is not a suffi-\ncient condition, it is well stated by the Buddha that only when avijj\u0101 ceases once and for all \ndoes vedan\u0101 never generate ta\u1e47h\u0101! This means that one doesn\u2019t \u201ccut\u201d the process using sati \non vedan\u0101. Sati is not enough. The process stops from the cessation of \u0101vijj\u0101, as Dependent \nCessation makes abundantly clear. The cessation of avijj\u0101 is much more than the practice of \nsati. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n (Brahmava\u1e41so 2003b:65) \n \nThe cycle of dependent arising, then, is broken with the destruction of ignorance.

The law of dependent arising is the most profound observations of the nature of existence \never formulated. It is therefore not surprising that differing purposes have been attributed to it. Most \nteachers agree that dependent arising explains unsatisfactoriness (dukkha) and its ending, but this is only \npartly true.  \n   \nA philosophical purpose of dependent arising is to provide an empirical explanation of the causal and \nrelative evolution of a person \u201cin place of an explanation in terms of metaphysical first causes and final \ncauses\u201d (Jayatilleke, Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, 1963:451), thus avoiding the problems of the \nextremes of theism and atheism.   \n \nWe will discuss 3 purposes of dependent arising, which are as follows:127 \n \n(1) To explain how there can be rebirth without a soul. [19.2] \n(2) To answer the question, \u201cWhat is life?\u201d [19.3] \n(3) To understand why there is suffering and how suffering comes to an end. [19.4] \n \n19.2 REBIRTH WITHOUT A SOUL   \n \n19.2.1 Dependent arising shows how a process, free of any soul flows, within our present life, and from \none life into another, and over many lives. It also explains how the karma we had done in a previous life \ncan affect us in this life. According to dependent arising, rebirth is generated in two sequences: \n \n(1) ignorance (avijj\u0101) + karma \u2192 the stream of consciousness beginning at rebirth (vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a). \n(2) craving (ta\u1e47h\u0101) + clinging/fuel (up\u0101d\u0101na) \u2192 existence (bhava) + rebirth into that existence (j\u0101ti). \n \nThese parallel sequences describe the same process from two perspectives, which, when combined, reads: \n \n \nDeluded kamma and craving produce the fuel which generates existence and rebirth (into that \nexistence), thereby giving rise to the start of the stream of consciousness that is at the heart of \nthe new life. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Brahmava\u1e41so 2003b:70) \n \n \n127 Buddhaghosa gives 4 points that arise from the teaching of dependent arising (VbhA 198 f).

Illustrates the Buddhist concept that both good karma and craving are needed for rebirth, while good karma without craving leads to liberation. Extends this explanation through the Bhava Sutta's seed metaphor where karma is the field, consciousness is the seed, and craving is the moisture needed for rebirth.\nPiya Tan    \n \n \nSD 5.16 Dependent arising \nhttp://dharmafarer.org \n146 \n19.2.2 Karma and craving, both under the sway of ignorance (or delusion), are the forces that propel the \nstream of consciousness into a new life. To illustrate this, Brahmava\u1e41so gives a delightful simile: \n \n \nSomeone goes to an airport to fly to another country. If they [sic] have enough money for \nthe fare and they have a desire to go to a new country, then they may arrive in that land. If they \nhave the fare but not the desire, or the desire but not the fare, or they lack both, then they will \nnot arrive in that land. If they have the fare but not the desire, or the desire but not the fare, or \nthey lack both, then they will not arrive in the new country.  \n \nIn this simile: the person stands for the stream of consciousness; the airport stands for \ndeath; the new country stands for the next life; the fare stands for the person\u2019s accumulated \nkamma; and their desire to go there stands for craving. With much good kamma and a craving \nfor happiness, or just the craving to be, the stream of consciousness that one thinks of a \u201cme\u201d is \npropelled into one\u2019s chosen next life.  \n \nBut with much bad kamma and a craving for happiness, one cannot reach the happiness one \nwants, and thus one is propelled into an unsatisfactory next life. With much bad kamma and a \ncraving for punishment, what we recognize in this life as a guilt complex, one falls into a next life \nof suffering. \n \nThen with much good karma and no craving at all, one goes nowhere. Like the traveller at \nthe airport, they have enough money to go wherever they want first-class, but the delusion [or \nignorance] has been shattered and the desire that generated all this coming-and-going is no \nmore. They cease at the airport.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n (Brahmava\u1e41so 2003b:70) \n \n19.2.3 Like the (Kamma) Nid\u0101na Sutta (A 3.331:134 f), the Bhava Sutta (A 3.76) too compares karma to \nseeds: \n \n \n \nIti kho \u0100nanda kamma\u1e41 khetta\u1e41 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a\u1e41 b\u012bja\u1e41 ta\u1e47h\u0101 sineho avijj\u0101\u2019avara\u1e47\u0101na\u1e41 satt\u0101na\u1e41 \nta\u1e47h\u0101,sa\u1e41yojan\u0101na\u1e41 h\u012bn\u0101ya dh\u0101tuy\u0101 \u2026 majjhim\u0101ya dh\u0101tuy\u0101 \u2026 pa\u1e47it\u0101ya dh\u0101tuy\u0101 vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a\u1e41 \npati\u1e6d\u1e6dhita\u1e41.

Examines the paradox between existence and non-existence through analogies and explains how dependent arising demonstrates that while nothing permanently exists, phenomena still arise conditionally.\nSD 5.16 \n \n            Dependent arising                             \n \nhttp://dharmafarer.org \n \n147 \nremainderless fading away and ending of ignorance, \u2026 the ending of birth, there end decay-and-death, \nsorrow, lamentation, physical pain, mental pain and despair\u2014such is the ending of this whole mass of \nsuffering\u201d (S 12.1).128 It is this impersonal process that we identify as life. \n \nIt is not easy to notice this process because we are regularly confronted by what appears to be a \n\u201csoul,\u201d or some kind of abiding entity. The best examples are our body itself (part of n\u0101ma,rupa); then, \nthere is our will (part of the sa\u1e45kh\u0101r\u0101, or sometimes ta\u1e47h\u0101), love (part of sa\u1e45kh\u0101r\u0101, then mostly part of \nup\u0101d\u0101na, clinging), and consciousness (vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a).  \nWhen we carefully examine these conditions masquerading as some kind of \u201cself\u201d or \u201csoul,\u201d in the \nlight of dependent arising, we clearly see and understand them to be impermanent, insubstantial, \ngranular and fading away soon after they arise.  \nThey are all conditioned, existing only as long as they are supported by external causes, which are \nthemselves unstable. When the external causes disappear, so do all these conditions. None of these \nreally persist because they do not continue in being. Hence, it is untenable to hold for us to hold that \nthere is a soul, a self or a God.129 \n \n\u201cGranular\u201d here means that dependent arising comprises of \u201ctiny moments of consciousness, un-\ncountable in number, close together but not touching, and each alone\u201d like the sand on a beach that \nlooks level and continuous, but which, on closer examination, reveals that the grains are really discrete \nparticles (2003b: 72 f). \n \n19.3.3 Dependent arising. When the Buddha declares that it is also untenable to maintain that nothing \nexists because an arising is seen, by which he means dependent arising: \u201cwith ignorance as condition, \nthere are volitional formations; \u2026 with birth as condition there arises decay-and-death, sorrow, lament-\nation, physical pain, mental pain and despair\u2014such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering.\u201d (S \n12.1).130 Here again we seen an impersonal process that we identify as life. In this sense, life is real.  \n \nHere is a simile. In mathematics, a point is a helpful concept\u2014it does not really exist. It describes \naspects of real phenomena. Yet a point has no size: it is smaller than any measure that you can think of, \nbut it is bigger than nothing. We cannot say that a point exists because it does not persist, it does not \ncontinue in space and time. Yet, we cannot say it is not, as it is clearly not nothing. The point is, in fact, \nsimilar to the momentary nature of our conscious experience. Nothing persists in being, therefore it \ncannot be something. Yet, something does arise, therefore it cannot be nothing. The solution to this \nparadox, the excluded middle, is the impersonal process.131 \n \n19.4 WHY SUFFERING?  \n \n19.4.1 How suffering arises and ends.The main purpose of dependent arising is to explain why we suffer \nand the way to end this suffering. As mentioned earlier [5], birth (j\u0101ti) produces suffering (dukkha). There-\nfore, the only escape from suffering is to cease from being reborn. As S\u0101riputta declares to the wanderer \nS\u0101ma\u1e47\uf0b6ak\u0101ni: \n \n \n \nAbhinibbatti kho \u0101vuso dukkh\u0101; anabhinibbatti sukh\u0101. \n \n \nTo be reborn, friend, is suffering; not to be reborn is happiness.

We think someone else is to blame. When anyone points out that it is the very nature of a prison \nto be a place of suffering, we dismiss them as a pessimist, even being crazy. Some of our cleverer talka-\ntive leaders scold him, saying: \u201cGet a life!\u201d \n \nOne full moon night, a few of us discover a raft along the shore-line. We are not sure what it is at \nfirst.

We, close friends, get on the raft and quietly paddle away as the sun \nrises in the horizon.

One important observation Waldron makes is this: \n \n \n\u2026 in the biological view, \u2026 the very minds and bodies we embody today reflect the gradually \naccumulated results of reproductively successful interactions between our forebears and their \nnatural and social environments. As with our analysis of cognitive awareness, evolutionary \ntheory here shifts our attention from the arising of entities to the recurrent patterns of interact-\nion. What \u201cevolves,\u201d biological philosophers Maturana and Varela observe, \u201cis always a unit of \ninteractions\u201d (1980:12), neither the organism by itself, and certainly not the environment alone, \nbut rather the organism-in-environment. In other words, it is patterns of interaction that \nevolves, representing for each species an \u201cevolution of [its] cognitive domains.\u201d And, similarly \nand reciprocally, the evolution of its cognitive domain is the evolution of the \u201cworld\u201d\u2014for that \nkind of organism\u2014a process Maturana and Varela call a \u201cstructural coupling with the world.\u201d \n(Waldron 2002:146; footnotes omitted.) \n \n146 Well known examples of the causal conditions for social problems are found in Cakka,vatti S\u012bha,n\u0101da S (D 26, \nesp \u00a7\u00a79-21/3:64-73), SD 36.10, Agga\u00f1\u00f1a S (D 27, esp \u00a7\u00a716-20/3:88-93), SD 2.19, and V\u0101se\u1e6d\u1e6dha S (M 98, esp \u00a7\u00a76-\n13/2:196 = Sn 594-656), SD 37.1.

        "page_content": "Focuses on concluding reflections about dependent arising as a universal principle, drawing connections to modern scientific understanding of organisms and environments as interdependent systems. Explores how dependent arising challenges traditional models of autonomous human agency and suggests we are collectively responsible for constructing our shared reality. Leads into the final summary section that synthesizes the key points about dependent arising as a middle way between extremes and a path to liberation.\nPiya Tan    \n \n \nSD 5.16 Dependent arising \nhttp://dharmafarer.org \n152 \n19.6.2  He significantly concludes his paper with these insightful words: \n \n \n \nFor once we start thinking of organisms as complex dynamic organizations interacting in \npatterned relationships with their environments, our older, ultimately alienating, models of \nhuman beings, as autonomous agents unilaterally acting on, or passively being acted upon, an \nindependent, external and pre-existing world becomes limited at best and misleading at worst. \nThe constructive power of these models comes not only from the idea that we can understand \nliving processes better by understanding the patterns of interaction through which they arise, \nthat is, their \u201cdependent arising,\u201d but also from the notion that we are collectively responsible \nfor the world we continuously construct together. For if we are not really trapped inside our \nheads, but are causally as well as cognitively intersubjective through and through, then it \nmatters indeed which particular concepts, categories and classifications we produce, proclaim \nand protect.                                                                          (Waldron 2002:152 f; footnotes omitted.) \n \n \n   \n20 Summary  \n \n20.1  The teaching of dependent arising shows the causal relationship or interdependence of psychological \nand existential factors. Its purpose is to show how suffering (both personal and social) arises and how it can \nbe overcome [19.5]. From the varying lengths of the dependent arising formulae and their components \nfound in the Nik\u0101yas, it is clear that no strict causality and no strict time sequence were intended, and that \nthe sequence could be taken to occur in a single thought moment [3; 9], within a single life [11] or over \nthree lives (or more) [8; 10]. \n \n20.2  In explaining how the human situation arises from an interaction of causes and effects, the law of de-\npendent arising avoids the extremes of fatalism and of determinism (A 1:173). Putting ignorance as the \nbasis of the causal chain, the law need not resort to the theory of chance (A 3:440) or fortuitous origina-\ntion (D 1:27), or of moral licence and bondage (A 3:440).148 Dependent arising is primarily used to explain \nkarma and rebirth without resorting to the two extremes of Upani\u1e63adic eternalism (\u201ceternal self-identical \nsoul\u201d) and of amoral materialism (which denies survival after death and moral responsibility). Dependent \narising is a universal law, when reflected upon and applied to our daily life, would free our mind and liber-\nate us spiritually. \n \n  20.3  The law of dependent arising serves as a heuristic method of \u201cself-discovery\u201d by which we can see \nthe causal process of the arising of the illusion of a \u201cperson\u201d and of pain without resorting to the extreme \nnotions of \u201cbeing\u201d (everything is) and \u201cnon-being\u201d (nothing is), and the extremes of monism (all is one) \nand pluralism (all things are different) (S 2:77). When any of the causal links is broken, the whole wheel \nstops turning and falls apart. In other words, it is possible for us to get out of this cyclic rut.149 \n \n \nNirvana is the ending of existence (bhava,nirodho nibb\u0101na\u1e41). (Kosambi Sutta, S 12.68/2:177) \n \n \n\u2014  \u2014  \u2014 \n \n \n148 See B C Law, Concepts of Buddhism, Delhi: Gian, 1986:20 f & B Barua, A History of Pre-Buddhistic Indian \nPhilosophy, 1921, repr 1970:77 ff.",

This appears at the end of a comprehensive explanation of how dependent arising works as a universal law that, when applied to daily life, can lead to spiritual liberation. Makes a brief connection to Western philosophical methods, specifically Mill's logical methods, suggesting parallels in causal analysis approaches.\n149 Those familiar with philosophy will see some interesting correlations between dependent arising and J S Mill\u2019s \nMethods of Agreement and of Difference.

For this reason, in what follows I attempt to provide \na starting point for understanding dependent arising. \nA particularly helpful discourse for appreciating the \nsignificance of dependent arising is the Paccaya-sutta, \nwhich states that \u201cdependent arising\u201d (pa\u1e6dicca samupp\u0101da)",

One \nmight ask: Why did this person die? An answer could be \nthat the person had an accident or suffered from cancer. But \nthat is not really the decisive condition, at least on a funda-\nmental level. If the person did not have an accident and did \nnot have cancer, sooner or later death would still come.

Without being born, there would indeed be no \ndeath. \nA discourse reporting the Buddha\u2019s own pre-awak-\nening inquiry into dependent arising confirms that the cen-\ntral concern throughout is to identify the specific condition \nthat needs to cease in order to arrive eventually at freedom \nfrom dukkha. The first part of this inquiry takes the follow-\ning form:6 \nThen, monastics, it occurred to me: with what being \nthere do old age and death exist, what is the condition for \nold age and death? Then, monastics, through wise atten-\ntion there was a breakthrough by wisdom for me: with \nbirth being there, old age and death exist; birth is the con-\ndition for old age and death. \nThe fact that old age and death are to be expected for one \nwho has been born might at first sight not seem to warrant \nthe qualification of being a breakthrough by wisdom. Yet, \nthis qualification applies similarly to each ensuing step in \nthe entire investigation, which will eventually lead up to \nignorance as the condition that leads, via the other interven-\ning links, to old age and death, and hence to dukkha.  \nWhen viewed from the complementary cessation \nmode, this implies that the cessation of ignorance can bring \nabout complete freedom from old age and death. From this \nperspective, then, the qualification of being a breakthrough \nby wisdom can more easily be appreciated. In fact, this",

After establishing that dependent arising reveals all experience as conditioned and empty of self, the text examines how early Buddhist teachings adapted pre-existing Vedic concepts of creation and consciousness.

Ex-\nperience or existence is nothing but conditions. This leaves \nno room for positing a self of any type.  \nThe Role of the Twelve Links \nWhereas the reasoning leading from birth to old age and \ndeath might well appear straightforward, the same does not \nnecessarily apply to all of the other links leading from igno-\nrance up to this point.  \nIn order to appreciate the beginning part of the \nstandard application of dependent arising by way of twelve \nlinks, it can be helpful to take into account research by Jo-\nanna Jurewicz, who pointed out an antecedent in a Vedic \ncreation myth.7 In what follows I attempt to provide a sim-\nplified summary of her findings relevant to my topic. \nThis creation myth begins with a state in which cog-\nnition is not possible (counterpart to the first link of igno-\nrance). Next, out of this state there arises somehow a first \nimpulse, sometimes expressed with a term etymologically \nrelated to formations (the second link).  \nFollowing that comes the manifestation of becoming \nconscious (corresponding to the third link of conscious-\nness). Then follows what could perhaps be called individua-\ntion, which involves the coming into being of name and of \nform (the fourth link of name-and-form).  \nGiven this precedent, it can be assumed that the for-\nmulation of these links in the standard application of de-\npendent arising might have stood in some form of a dia-\nlogue with this Vedic creation myth.

Describes a progression from experiencing intense fear of death's messengers to finding solace by seeking protection from various enlightened beings including Samantabhadra, Ma\u00f1jugho\u1e63a, and Avalokite\u015bvara. Part of Chapter II's broader theme of confession and seeking spiritual refuge, specifically transitioning from acknowledging mortality to embracing Buddhist protection.\n44. If that is so, then how desperate will I be,\nWhen stricken down and gravely ill with fear,\nI am seized by the messengers of Death,\nAnd their gruesome, terrifying forms appear?\n45. Is there anyone who can really save me\nFrom the horrors of this appalling fate?\nStaring in terror with my eyes opened wide,\nI\u2019ll search all around to find a refuge place.\n46. When nowhere do I see such a place of safety,\nMy heart will sink; depressed, I\u2019ll give up hope.\nFor if there is no haven to which I might retreat,\nWhat options am I left with? What is there to do?\n47. Thus, from this day onwards I take refuge\nIn the buddhas, the guardians of the world,\nWho labour to protect and benefit us all,\nAnd whose great strength can banish every fear.\n48. Likewise, I genuinely take refuge\nIn the Dharma they have realized,\nWhich eliminates sa\u1e43s\u0101ra\u2019s terror,\nAnd also in the hosts of bodhisattvas.\n49.

Just like a great inferno at the ends of time,\nIt annihilates terrible misdeeds in but an instant.\nThus its benefits are vast beyond all measuring,\nAs the wise Lord Maitreya explained to Sudhana.\n15.

But there is also a view that their attainment may be in\nquick succession, or even that one might \u2018leap\u2019 as it were, directly\nto one or other of the fruits.48\nAbhidharma (Pali: Abhidhamma)\nAs we have seen, the term \u2018Abhidharma\u2019 refers fundamentally to\nthe third section (Pitaka) of the Buddhist canon (the Tripitaka). It\nalso refers derivatively to the teachings, approach, and insight\ncontained in that section of the canon, as well as their explanation,\nelaboration, and summaries contained in later commentaries,\ncompendiums, and digests, such as the Abhidharmakosa of\nVasubandhu. Only two complete Abhidharma canonical collections\nremain: the Theravada Abhidhamma in the Pali Canon, and the\nSarvastivada (Vaibhasika) Abhidharma that survives mainly in\nChinese translation.49 Both consist of seven books, but they are\nquite different books. In the Theravada Pali Canon the\nAbhidhamma section is attributed directly to the Buddha himself,\nalthough at least one book (the Kathavatthu) is also said to be the\nwork of a certain Moggaliputtatissa and clearly relates to doctrinal\ndisputes which occurred long after the death of the Buddha. All\nthe books of the Sarvastivada Abhidharma are attributed to various\nelders other than the Buddha, but the claim is that those elders\nwere compilers rather than authors in that they assembled the\nbooks from material scattered throughout the canon. Another\nschool, the Sautrantika, while accepting the approach and many of\nthe tenets of the Abhidharma, appears to have gained its name\n(\u2018those who follow the sutras\u2019) through a rejection by its adherents\nof any claim that the Buddha himself actually spoke the\nAbhidharma.\nThe controversies concerning the status of the Abhidharma\nbooks should indicate that we are dealing here with material that\nin the form in which we have it now is certainly somewhat later\nthan the Vinaya and Sutra parts of the canon.

Describes how Abhidharma breaks down seemingly unified experiences into their constituent psychological and physical factors to reveal ultimate reality beneath conventional appearances. Illustrates this through the example of analyzing the Buddha's statement about receiving a strawberry to show how apparent unities are actually flows of impermanent factors.\n88\nBuddhist Thought\nsummary lists of the main topics of a teaching prepared for\nmemorisation. With the evolution of the Abhidharma, and\nAbhidharma style, however, what we find emerging are not just\nlists of essential points in the discourses. Rather, we find lists\nwhich enumerate with the maximum possible exactitude what is\nactually occurring in a particular psychological or physical\nsituation spoken of in the sutras or occurring in life generally. The\nlists are lists of what is seen to be the case by one who sees things\nthe way they really are. The Abhidharma lists are exhaustive lists\nof possible psychophysical events. They thus correspond to\u2014and\nalso form a template for\u2014the contents of insight meditation.\nThe Buddha might say \u2018Oh monks, on my alms-round I was\ngiven a strawberry\u2019. But if he were to speak with maximum\npossible exactitude there would be no independently real thing\nreferred to by \u2018I\u2019, in the way it is experienced by a person who is\nunenlightened.

If we were to speak with maximum possible\nexactitude here, how would we analyse this situation? The answer\nwould involve listing various psychological and physical factors,\neach of which is impermanent, and each of which is here relating\nto the others in a particular sort of causal relationship. Which\ntypes of psychological and physical factors are those, and what\ntypes of causal relationship are there? How, in this specific\nsituation, do the psychological and physical factors come together\nin causal relationship? This is what the Abhidharma texts are all\nabout.\nAs we have seen, implicit in Buddhist philosophy from the very\nbeginning was a distinction between the way things appear to be\nand the way they actually are. Buddhist thought tends to look\nbeyond apparent stability, apparent unity, to a flow of composite\nparts which are elaborated by mental processes of construction and\nreification into the relatively stable entities of our everyday\nworld.50 There appears to be a Self, but really there is not.

Explains how Buddhist analysis seeks to probe beyond surface appearances to discover ultimate truths through investigation and meditation. Introduces the concept of dharmas as fundamental building blocks of reality, using material form (rupa) as an example of how conventional understanding differs from ultimate analysis.\nMainstream Buddhism: a Buddha\u2019s basic thought\n89\nthe flow of consciousness. The way things appear to be is one\nthing, the way they are actually is another. Quite early in the\ndevelopment of Buddhist thought\u2014certainly in the Abhidharma\u2014\nthis distinction issued in a clear distinction between conventional\nreality (or \u2018truth\u2019; samvrtisatya; Pali: sammutisacca), and the\nultimate way of things, how it really is (paramarthasatya; Pali:\nparamatthasacca). The religio-philosophical project of the\nBuddhist lies in knowing directly the conventional as conventional,\nrather than investing it with an illusory ultimacy. The ultimate\ntruth, how it really is, lies precisely in the fact that what appeared\nto be ultimate is merely conventional. It appeared that there was a\nSelf, but really there is only a flow of the aggregates and the Self\nis just an artificial unity, a self, oneself, the person one is, in fact a\npragmatic conventional construct. But once we adopt this\nperspective it is clear that even talk of \u2018five aggregates\u2019 is simply\nshorthand for a far more complex list of types of psychophysical\nimpermanent factors that might occur.\nThe common approach of Buddhist philosophy, experienced in\ninsight meditation, is to probe, to investigate. The terminating\npoint of that analysis\u2014what the analysis finds is actually there,\nwhat is therefore resistant to the probing, dissolving analysis\u2014is\nspoken of as \u2018how it is\u2019, i.e. an \u2018ultimate truth\u2019 (or an \u2018ultimate\nreality\u2019). In Buddhist thought in the immediate centuries after the\ndeath of the Buddha this probing analysis was taken further, and\neven the five aggregates as simple unities were seen as obscuring a\nfurther dissolution, analysis into a plurality of further elements.\nThis analysis rapidly came to embrace not just the psychophysical\naggregates of a conscious being but also to include all things in\nthe universe. These elements were known as dharmas (Pali:\ndhammas), \u2018phenomena\u2019, or maybe just \u2018factors\u2019. The dharmas\nform the psychophysical building blocks of the world as\nexperienced by us.\nFor example, take the first aggregate, material form (rupa). If\nwe want to talk about how it really is, material form does not\noccur. \u2018Material form\u2019 is not a dharma. Rather, this expression is\nshorthand for the occurrence of particular instances of (in the\nancient Indian system) solidity (\u2018earth\u2019), and/or fluidity (\u2018water\u2019),",

Describes how Abhidharma texts use precise \"how-it-actually-is language\" to describe ultimate truth, in contrast to the more contextual language of the Sutras. Explains the Theravada Abhidhamma system's classification of 82 types of dharmas, with 81 being conditioned and only nirvana being unconditioned.\n90\nBuddhist Thought\nor heat (\u2018fire\u2019), or motion (\u2018air\u2019), and various other possible\nphysical factors derived from these. These are related in some sort\nof causal connection (perhaps presenting thereby the physical\nobject \u2018strawberry\u2019). Thus in general under \u2018material form\u2019 comes\nvarious classes of things. Is it the same for a specific case of e.g.\nsolidity itself? It seems not. An instance of solidity is irreducible\nto some further factors. Thus an instance of solidity, transient as it\nis, is what is really there, seen by one who sees things the way\nthey really are. An instance of solidity is thus a dharma. The\nAbhidharma texts set out to offer a list of all the types of factors\ninto which experiences can be analysed when we aim to find what\nis \u2018really there\u2019. They also explain how these link up causally and\nrelate to each other in order to provide us with the actual world of\nlived experience. Thus the Abhidharma texts, in contrast to e.g. the\nSutras, are phrased in \u2018how-it-actually-is language\u2019, universally\nvalid, and not in the loose speech of everyday discourse in which\nthe Buddha spoke when he spoke in a manner appropriate to the\nactual teaching situation he was in. Therefore we also find\nessential to Buddhist exegesis a distinction between texts or\ndiscourses that are definitive and tell it as it is (Sanskrit: nitartha;\nPali: nitattha), and those that were phrased the way they are\nphrased with a particular purpose in view. If we are interested in\nprecision these latter texts or discourses require to be interpreted,\nto have their meaning \u2018drawn out\u2019 (neyartha; Pali: neyyattha). In\ngeneral for their advocates Abhidharma texts, and Abhidharma\ndiscourses, concern ultimate truth (paramarthasatya), and are\ndefinitive (nitartha).\nThe Theravada Abhidhamma produced a list of eighty-two\nclasses of dhammas.51 That is, all possible experience can be\nanalysed into events each one of which will be an instance of one\nor other of the eighty-two classes of dhammas. Eighty-one of\nthese (types of) dhammas are said to be conditioned (Sanskrit:\nsamskrta; Pali: samkhata: the direct result of causes). One,\nnibbana, is unconditioned (asamskrta/asamkhata). Thus,\ntechnically, for the Theravada Abhidhamma nibbana is an ultimate,\na dhamma. This means that in the most general sense nibbana\nforms the content of an experiential event that cannot be analysed",

That is how\none knows one has a case of solidity.\nThe eighty-one conditioned dhammas fall into three classes:\nconsciousness (citta=vi\u00f1\u00f1ana (Sanskrit: vij\u00f1ana)), mental\nassociates (cetasikas; Sanskrit: caitasikas), and material or\nphysical form (rupa). Consciousness consists of one dhamma.\nMental associates consist of fifty-two dhammas.

I have already suggested\nthat there is no such opposition in (Indian) Buddhism.\nAbhidhamma analysis does indeed involve seeing things as they\nare, and that is a matter of ontology. The dhammas (excluding, of\ncourse, nibbana) are evanescent events, linked by an impersonal\ncausal law. That is how it truly is.\nThe Abhidhamma texts are committed to the view that dhammas\nare how things really are. This does not commit the texts, however,\nto any particular position on the exact nature of the dhamma beyond\nthe contrast between dhammas as what are not further reducible,\ncompared with, say, persons, or tables and chairs which are. What is\ninvolved in seeing dhammas as events, in seeing all as based\nperhaps on an event-ontology, rather than a substance-ontology,\nseems to be relatively unexplored in the Pali Abhidhamma or indeed\nin the Theravada thought which follows it.

I want to mention here\nbriefly, however, the Sarvastivadin approach to the ontology of the\ndharma. In India as a whole in classical times the Sarvastivada\n(although it has not survived into the present day as an\nindependent school) appears to have been by far the most\nimportant and influential of the Abhidharma traditions.

An \u2018ultimate truth/\nreality\u2019 is discovered as that which is resistant to attempted\ndissolution through reductive analysis. This search is animated by\nthe wish to let-go, to bring to an end all selfish craving after\nthings that turn out to be just mental and cultural imputations,\nconstructions for practical purposes. Absurd craving for such\nthings leads to rebirth. It seems to me that all Buddhist thinkers in\nIndia agreed in the direction of this analysis. There is no\ndisagreement that you and me, or tables, or chairs, can be\nanalysed into component parts and in reality lack the unities that\nare imputed upon them simply for practical everyday purposes.\nDisagreements among Buddhist thinkers in this area centred on\nclaims to have found those elements that are really there behind\nmere appearance.

Thus the\ndissolution of what we might call \u2018everyday\u2019 craving through\ndissolution of the everyday world is agreed and taken for granted.\nThe real disagreement concerned the craving which one group of\nBuddhist thinkers would attribute to another in the light of the\nlatter\u2019s claim to have found ultimate truths which are not accepted\nas ultimate by the former.

It is to bear a\nparticular sort of existence, the existence of an entity that is quite\ncorrectly treated as a unity for pragmatic purposes but nothing\nmore. It can be analysed into a plurality of constituents which are\nthus to be taken as ontologically more fundamental. A conceptual\nexistent is genuinely existent, but it is existent (i.e. given as a\nunity) through a purposeful, pragmatic context and its unity is\nfixed through conceptual reification. Thus a conceptual existent is\nthe result of a particular sort of causal process, a conceptual\nreification or unification out of a plurality.

Discusses how Buddhist schisms were caused by divergences in monastic rules and behavioral practices rather than differences in beliefs or doctrine. Illustrates through examples how practical behavioral differences (like meal times) could disrupt monastery functioning, while differing views on enlightenment goals did not necessarily cause problems.\n98\nBuddhist Thought\nClassical India was not a threat, and/or was not taken seriously.\nThis could be because in spite of the size of the literature there\nwere throughout much of the period of Buddhism in India very\nfew monks who actually adopted the Mahayana vision, and those\nmonks were just thought by their brethren to be a bit weird\u2014but\nharmless. Alternatively it could be because in terms of what is to\ncount as a threat among those who have come together to live a\nsimple and cenobitic lifestyle the Mahayana was not a rival. I\nsuspect it may be a combination of both of these factors.4\nThanks to the work of Heinz Bechert (1982) we now have a\nclearer idea of what is to count as generating schism in Buddhist\nmonasticism. For Buddhists \u2018schism\u2019 is nothing to do with\ndoctrinal disagreements as such, but is the result of divergence in\nmonastic rule.5 This makes sense. The whole purpose of Buddhist\nmonasticism is for groups of people to live together a simple life\nwith optimum facilities for inner development. What produces\nmajor disagreement in such contexts\u2014and can lead to schism,\n\u2018splitting the Sangha\u2019 (samghabheda) \u2014are what for non-\nmonastics would appear to be fairly minor matters of behavioural\ndisagreement. Thus if a monk holds that it is permissible to eat\nafter midday, while all his brethren have to finish their meal before\nmidday, this could cause great problems for the peaceful running\nof the monastery. Further difficulties could arise for the crucial\nissue of the harmonious relationship between the monastery and\nthe local lay community. Imagine the response of the lay\nsupporters to their farming day being disrupted by two groups of\nmonks from the local monastery on the alms-round at different\ntimes. One could see that under such circumstances it might be\nbetter for all concerned that the divergent monk (and those who\nagree) \u2018split\u2019. Suppose on the other hand that a monk holds the\nfinal goal of all should be not nirvana but perfect Buddhahood for\nthe benefit of all sentient beings. Or he believes that in meditation\nhe is receiving personal tuition from a Buddha called Amitayus\nunknown to other monks. This might be thought by many of his\nbrethren to be pretty peculiar. But providing it does not lead to\nintolerable levels of disruptive behaviour\u2014and why should it? \u2014\nour monk\u2019s Mahayana views need not lead to a \u2018schism\u2019.",

What\nis important is harmony of behaviour, not harmony of doctrines.\nThe role played by doctrinal disagreements in Christian history\ndoes not apply in the case of Buddhism. Of course, where there\nis a genuine schism related to the monastic rule there could also\ntake place subsequently doctrinal variation. But doctrinal\ndifference as such cannot be a matter for schism. Thus since\nMahayana is, as I shall argue, a matter of vision and motivation\nwhich does not (or need not) in itself entail behaviour\nconfrontational to the monastic rule, it could not have resulted\nfrom schism. It is not that sort of thing. It is not that sort of\n\u2018animal\u2019.

On both counts there are however\nproblems. Suffice to say that it is looking very unlikely that the\n\u2018wicked monks of Vaisali were the origins of the\nMahasamghikas, and few contemporary scholars would identify\nMahayana in a straightforward way with any particular Vinaya\ntradition (or non-Mahayana \u2018school\u2019). Inasmuch as we can\ndetect from Mahayana sources the Vinaya or perhaps\nAbhidharma presuppositions of the compilers of those sources,\nwe can see that Mahayana tendencies cut across the boundaries\nof the non-Mahayana traditions. For example, there is a clear\nassociation between the Ta-chih-tu Lun (Mahapraj\u00f1aparamita\nSastra), the enormous compendium of Mahayana attributed to\nNagarjuna and translated into Chinese by Kumarajiva in the\nearly fifth century CE, and monks from the Sarvastivada/\nVaibhasika tradition of Kashmir. But the Mahayana\nLokanuvartana Sutra on the other hand shows a strong\ntendency towards the idea that the Buddha is in some sense\nalways supramundane, and the teaching of emptiness, which are\nboth associated with the Mahasamghikas (see pp. 128\u201330).\nThe Theravada Vinaya is one particular Vinaya, and indeed a\nmonk can be defined as a Theravadin (a follower of Theravada)\nprecisely inasmuch as he has been ordained and lives according to\nthe Theravada Vinaya. In India in classical times, however, it\nseems likely that one of the most important Vinayas was that of\nthe Mulasarvastivada, the Vinaya which also to the present day\nguides the monastic vision of Tibetans. In China, and traditions\ninfluenced by China, among others the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya\nwas popular. All these Vinayas are Vinayas which evolved over the\ncenturies, but\u2014and this is crucially important\u2014they have\nabsolutely nothing to do with issues of Mahayana versus non-\nMahayana. There is no such thing as a Mahayana Vinaya.7 Thus\nMahayana cannot have originated as such in a schism. Moreover\nin a very real sense there cannot have been any Mahayana monks\nin India, since identity as a monk is a Vinaya matter, although of\ncourse there can certainly have been monks who held a Mahayana\nvision and motivation. Once we understand that Mahayana identity\nis not a matter of the Vinaya and therefore not a matter of publicly",

We know that such practices were popular from a\nvery early period, and that one of the results of these practices is\nthat the meditator feels as if in the presence of the Buddha himself\n(Williams 1989:30, 217\u201320; Harrison 1978). In the Pratyutpanna\nSutra, translated into Chinese by Lokaksema and studied by Paul\nHarrison, we find details of a visualisation practice in which the\nmeditator visualises Buddha Amitayus in his \u2018Pure Land\u2019 (Buddha\nField; q.v.) in the West, for twenty-four hours a day, for a whole\nweek. After that, the sutra says, the meditator may have a vision\nof Amitayus, and receive new teachings not before heard.\nMoreover these new teachings the meditator is exhorted to\ntransmit and expound to mankind.\nIt seems certain that a text like the Pratyutpanna Sutra (and\nperhaps other early Mahayana texts associated with Pure Lands\nand buddhanusmrti) describes practices which can lead to\nrevelatory visions, and the Pratyutpanna Sutra itself advocates the\npromulgation of the teachings thus received. But while visions can\noccur in meditation, the occurrence of visions\u2014messages\napparently from a Buddha\u2014does not explain why someone would\ntake those messages seriously. Indeed the Buddhist tradition in\ngeneral has tended to be very cautious, even dismissive,\nconcerning visions seen in meditation. Of course, if it is correct\nthat for many centuries there were very few followers of\nMahayana in classical India, then the problem becomes less acute.\nBut certainly some people took these revelations seriously, and\nthose who took them seriously were sometimes great scholars. It is\noften said that the standard view of early Buddhism is that after\nthe death of a Buddha he is beyond reference or recall,\nsignificantly and religiously dead.

As\nwe shall see, this is indeed a strategy commonly adopted in\nMahayana sources. But recent work by Gregory Schopen suggests\nthat the atmosphere in Buddhist circles in Ancient India may have\nbeen at least emotionally more receptive to the idea that a dead\nBuddha is still around than was previously realised. Schopen has\nargued on archaeological and inscriptional grounds that the\nBuddha\u2019s relics, preserved after his death in stupas, were felt to be\nthe Buddha himself. The Buddha was thought in some sense to be\nstill present in his relics and even in spots associated with his life\n(Schopen 1987a, 1990, 1994). Through his relics the Buddha was\nalso treated as if present in the monastery, and was treated legally\nby the monastery and apparently by the wider community as a\nperson with inalienable property rights.16 Schopen has shown that\nin day to day life the Buddha was felt very much to be present\namong the monks, if invisible.\nPerhaps it was little wonder, then, that certain monks, inspired\nby the common meditation practice of \u2018recollection of the\nBuddha\u2019, buddhanusmrti, felt the genuineness of their visions of\nhim and what had been revealed to them. Thus they arrived at the\npossibility of a continuing revelation and of course new sutras.17\nLittle wonder too, then, that eventually we find in some circles\nforms of religiosity developed centred on the supremacy of\nBuddhahood above all alternative goals. This religiosity focused\ntoo on the great compassion of one who remains present,\ntranscending even death, helping sentient beings. It encouraged the\nneed to attain a palpable immortality through becoming oneself a\nBuddha. In becoming a Buddha Sakyamuni, after all, is said to\nhave triumphed over the Evil One, the \u2018Devil\u2019, Mara. The\netymology of this name shows him to be the personification of\ndeath. Little wonder then that we also find in the meantime\nparticipation in \u2018Pure Land\u2019 cults, a need to see the Buddha if not\nin this life in meditation, then after death through rebirth in his\npresence in the Pure Land where he still dwells.18\nThus it seems clear from early Mahayana texts that through\nmeditation it was felt to be possible by some Buddhist",

The \u2018doctrine that all exist\u2019 concerns serious and perennial\nphilosophical issues arising out of apparent paradoxes when\nreferring to non-existence, specifically here past and future\ndharmas.2 If a dharma is impermanent, and ceases soon after its\narising, how can something which has ceased and is thus\napparently non-existent do anything? How can it serve as the\nobject of cognition (as in the case of memory), and how can it\nbring about an effect (as in the case of karman)? Moreover the\nsame could be said about future dharmas. How can they serve as\nthe objects of cognition or action, as occurs in anticipation and\nmotivated activity? In consideration of all this, the Sarvastivadin\nresponse was that past and future dharmas, while clearly not\nexisting in the same way as the momentary present dharmas, must\nnevertheless still exist. Something simply non-existent could not\nserve as a cognitive (an \u2018intentional\u2019) referent, nor could it bring\nabout an effect, as in the case of pain now occurring due to\nwicked deeds done in the past. Thus the \u2018doctrine that all exist\u2019 is\nspecifically the doctrine that if a dharma is a future, a present, or a\npast dharma it nevertheless still exists.3\nThe idea that dharmas exist when future, present, and past was\nfelt by rival schools (notably Sautrantika) to sail very close to an\nentailment that dharmas must actually be permanent.4 This need\nnot follow, however, providing one distinguishes sufficiently\nadequately existing as past and future from existing as present. We\nfind a number of attempts to do this even prior to the\nMahavibhasa, and detailed in that text with priority given to an\nexplanation by a certain Vasumitra. For the Sarvastivadin it was\nfelt to be clear, as Samghabhadra (late fourth or early fifth century\nCE?) pointed out, that past and future dharmas cannot possibly be\nabsolutely non-existent. They are not non-existent in the way that,\nfor example, the horn of a hare is simply non-existent (i.e. there is\nno such thing). Anything that can be a cognitive referent exists.\nBut in order to distinguish between existing simply in the way past\nand future dharmas do, and existing as present (and of course in\nthat respect impermanent) dharmas do, the Sarvastivadin brought\ninto play the notion of the \u2018own-existence\u2019 (svabhava) of a\ndharma. The own-existence, as we have seen, is possessed by each",

It was easy to slide from this to the own-existence as the\n\u2018what-it-is-ness\u2019 of the dharma, and thereby what is referred to\nevery time one speaks of that dharma. Thus the Sarvastivadin\nwants to say past and future dharmas exist simply in the mode of\ntheir own-existence (sasvabhavamatra). That is, each past and\nfuture dharma exists as its \u2018what-it-is-ness\u2019, and it is this that\nenables one to cognise and to speak about it. This sort of existence\nis always possessed by a dharma of that type. It is atemporal and\nis what makes the dharma the dharma it is. In the case of dharmas\nit enables us to talk in abstract, divorced from particular instances,\nabout dharmas. Thus we can speak of dharmas as \u2018not further\nanalysable\u2019, for example, and we can classify them into a list of\ndharmas. It is what we might call \u2018intentional existence\u2019. It is the\nsort of existence anything has solely inasmuch as it is an object of\nlanguage and cognition. The Sarvastivadin wants to suggest that\nbecause a past dharma has this sort of existence there is also no\nlonger any paradox in a result occurring of something that is past\nand otherwise non-existent. But in addition to existing this way,\npresent dharmas also have their characteristic activity (sakaritra).\nThat is, a present dharma does what that dharma does, as this is\nunderstood in the Abhidharma. The dharma\u2019s not yet doing what it\ndoes is what makes it a future dharma. Its doing what it does\nwhen the appropriate causes and conditions come together makes\nit a present dharma, and its ceasing to do what it does when the\ncauses and conditions cease is what renders it a past dharma. This\n\u2018doing-what-it-does\u2019 is instantaneous, momentary. Thus any\ndharma\u2019s being present is momentary. This is fully temporal, and\nsince we live in time and the occurrence (i.e. being present) of a\ndharma in time is momentary, momentariness is preserved.5\nA further interesting dimension of Sarvastivada thought worth\nnoting in passing is its analysis of causation itself. This is because,\nin a way that shows remarkable philosophical flexibility and\nadventurousness, the Sarvastivadin has no objection to the\nsimultaneity of cause and effect, and is even willing to entertain\nthe possibility that the effect may occur after the cause.",

Examines their unique philosophical perspective that allows for simultaneous cause and effect relationships, particularly in mental events. Describes how this view contrasts with rival Buddhist schools like Sautrantika, which insisted causes must precede effects.\n116\nBuddhist Thought\nSarvastivada speaks of six types of causes (hetu) and four types of\nconditions (pratyaya, see Hirakawa 1990:179\u201384). The first type\nof cause is the karanahetu, the \u2018efficient cause\u2019. This consists of\nevery other dharma apart from the dharma that is the effect itself,\ninasmuch as every dharma either contributes directly towards\nbringing about a further dharma (the cause as an \u2018empowered\u2019\nkaranahetu) or does not hinder its production (the cause as a\n\u2018powerless\u2019 karanahetu). Thus all things are one way or another\nlinked into the mesh of cause and effect. Here the class of\nkaranahetu is specifically said to incorporate causes that can be\neither prior to or simultaneous with the effect (Samghabhadra, in\nPotter 1999:704). Simultaneity is even more obvious in the case of\nthe \u2018simultaneous cause\u2019 (sahabhuhetu), which occurs where\ndharmas arise in a simultaneous relationship of mutual cause and\neffect. Thus, for example, since in a particular composite mental\nevent (like perceiving a strawberry) consciousness and its mental\nassociates arise together, if the consciousness occurs the mental\nassociates must occur, and if the mental associates occur the\nconsciousness must occur. If either consciousness or any of the\nmental associates is missing here, the others as parts of this\ncomposite mental event could not occur.6 Therefore they are here\nall mutually and simultaneously cause and effect. The\n\u2018homogeneous cause\u2019 (sabhagahetu), on the other hand, referring\nto cases of sequential concordance between causes and effects,\nmust obviously be prior to its effect. Thus, for example, prior\ngood causes give rise to subsequent good effects, prior bad causes\nto subsequent bad effects.7 The Abhidharmakosabhasya (2:52)\nconsiders also the possibility that the cause could occur\nchronologically after the effect, with support cited both for and\nagainst from the central Sarvastivadin canonical Abhidharma text,\nthe J\u00f1anaprasthana. The Kosabhasya itself rejects this possibility,\nbut throughout this text its author Vasubandhu frequently rejects\neven established Sarvastivadin positions in a way which shows his\nconsiderable sympathy with Sautrantika.8 From a Sautrantika\nperspective it is axiomatic that the cause must precede its effect.\nA unique Sarvastivadin doctrine, and once more a topic of\nintense debate with others, is that of \u2018possession\u2019 or \u2018ownership\u2019",

But the prapti generated\nanother prapti, this time the possession of \u2018having had that wicked\nintention\u2019. This prapti too is an impermanent dharma. On its\ncessation it too generates another similar possession. Thus as a\nresult of the original wicked intention part of my psychophysical\ncontinuum consists of an ongoing stream of praptis: \u2018having had\nthat wicked intention.\u2019 Eventually, when the conditions are right, a\nsuffering as the karmic result of that original intention will occur.\nThe original intention still exists in past-mode. And the suffering\nwill occur in the psychophysical continuum which has the prapti-\nseries \u2018having had that wicked intention\u2019, not in another one. In\nthe imprecise everyday terms used above, the karmic result will\noccur to me because I am the one who has the prapti-series\u2014I am\nthe one who possessed the original intention, not someone else.9\nSimilarly, an unenlightened being has a possession of the negative\ntaints (passions/defilements). Thus even when these taints are not\nactually operative in an unenlightened person, he or she is still not\nequivalent to an enlightened person, since the unenlightened\nperson still has a possession of the negative taints.

Therefore the appellation \u2018Sautrantika\u2019 could have\nbeen used to encompass a broad range of individual opinions\nthat conform to these general guidelines, rather than to a\ndefined and delimited set of doctrinal opinions.\n(Cox 1995:40)\n \nThe presence of scholars favouring Sautrantika shows the vitality\nand vigour of philosophical debate within the Buddhist tradition.\nDoctrinal positions were not identical with ordination lineages,\nand within one monastic group no doubt in the same monastery\nthere could be radical disagreement and discussion concerning\ndoctrinal issues within the context of a common rule of conduct.\nFollowers of Sautrantika rejected the existence of dharmas in the\nthree times, which they saw as necessarily implying the\npermanence of dharmas.

Thus exerting activity now becomes the\nmark not of the present stage of the dharma as such, but its very\nexistence. To be in fact is to exert activity.

Explains their doctrine that existence is instantaneous and that true reality consists only of infinitesimally brief moments.

Whatever the answer, it would follow\nthat the dharma actually existed in only one moment of the\nmoment. And this process could be traced to infinity, unless one\nadopted the position that the temporal moment is not itself\ndivisible into further moments. Thus the moment in which a\ndharma acts, in which existence occurs, has no time span beyond\nitself. It is absolutely instantaneous, so short that it can only be\nsaid to mark the infinitely short time-difference between the non-\nexistence before its existence, and the non-existence after its\nexistence. To be is to cease. Cessation is the very nature of\nbeing, and is said to occur to a dharma through its very nature as\nexisting. We are here stretching the bounds of language. The\nexistence of a dharma is so short in time that we can no longer\nspeak of it in terms of \u2018being\u2019 at all. Life can best be viewed as\nan ever-flowing process, and all talk of things, of beings, is\nmerely practical convenience that can easily mislead and\nengender attachment and consequential suffering.\nThe epistemology of all of this was particularly considered by\nthe philosophers Dinnaga (fifth or sixth century CE) and\nDharmakirti (seventh century), although it is not clear what the\nrelationship was between their views and the Sautrantika of, say,\nVasubandhu in the Abhidharmakosabhasya. If what actually exists\nendures for an infinitely small period of time before ceasing, then\nit follows that we never really see what we think we see. By the\ntime we have seen something, in any normal sense of \u2018seeing\u2019,\nthat thing has ceased to exist. According to Dinnaga\n(Pramanasamuccaya 1) only the very first moment of a veridical\nperceptual act apprehends what is actually there, the dharma. This\nfirst moment is thus referred to as \u2018without construction\u2019\n(nirvikalpa). The subsequent moments of what we normally call a\n\u2018perception\u2019 bring about the construction of a \u2018thing seen\u2019, which\nas we understand it is of course not a momentary entity at all.\nThese stages are called \u2018with construction\u2019 (savikalpa).

Thus what\nwe think we see is actually a constructed image, as such a fiction,\nand by the time the image (akara) has been fully constructed the\noriginal dharma has long ceased.11\nFollowers of Sautrantika utterly rejected the Sarvastivadin\ntheory of prapti, possession, along with the idea that a past\ndharma is able to cause its effect because the past dharma still\nexists as past. According to the Sautrantika theory, what happens\nin the case of karman and its effect is that when e.g. a wicked\nintention occurs the subsequent psychological continuum or series\n(samtana) of the person who has that intention is no longer what it\nwas. It is directly modified, and each moment of that series now\nbears the modification (perhaps analogous to a genetic imprint).\nThe last moment of the series qua modified series has a special\ncapacity to produce the effect. Thus the effect is the direct result\nof the preceding moment of the modified series, which is a result\nof the previous moment, and so on back to the original\nunwholesome intention.

Possibly too there are\neven innate seeds for wholesome activity. These theories\ncontributed to the Yogacara doctrine of the \u2018substratum\nconsciousness\u2019 (alayavij\u00f1ana; q.v.).\nFinally, as we have seen, the Sarvastivada speaks of three\nunconditioned dharmas. The most important of these is nirvana\nitself. As dharmas these bear primary or fundamental existence\n(they are dravyas).

Nirvana is not a positive thing, but a simple negation, a\nnon-existent (abhava), the simple cessation and therefore non-\nexistence of greed, hatred and delusion, suffering, and all the\nfactors of samsara.\nTheravada\nIt is normal in introductory works on Buddhism to equate\nTheravada with the Buddhism of its canon, the Pali Canon.

Both\nTheravada and Sarvastivada considered themselves to be simply\nexplicating and defending the original Buddhism of the Buddha.\nBoth could claim great antiquity, and both were nevertheless\nschools that developed over many centuries. Both schools had a\nvery great deal in common, but also doctrinal differences between\nthemselves and with other schools. As does Sarvastivada, the\nTheravada as a doctrinal school relies extensively on exegetical\nworks, such as the Milindapa\u00f1ha (\u2018Questions of [King] Milinda\u2019),\nthe commentaries to e.g. the Abhidhamma Pitaka, and particularly\nthe great Visuddhimagga (\u2018Path of Purity\u2019) of Buddhaghosa.

Discusses the Theravada position on consciousness between death and rebirth, contrasting it with other Buddhist schools' beliefs in an intermediate state.\nSome schools of Mainstream Buddhist thought\n123\nto combat other views and thus position Theravada as a doctrinal\nschool in opposition to its rivals.\nAccording to questionable tradition, doctrinal divisions occurred\nbetween Sarvastivada and a group known in Sanskrit as\n\u2018Sthaviravada\u2019 (\u2018the Doctrine of the Elders\u2019) over the issue of the\nexistence of dharmas in the three times. The Sthaviravadins\ndeclared themselves to be \u2018Distinctionists\u2019 (Sanskrit:\nVibhajyavadins; Pali: Vibhajjavadins). They accepted that dharmas\nexist in the present but denied that they exist in the future. As\nregards the past, the Distinctionists wished to make a distinction\nbetween a wholesome or unwholesome intention that has already\nissued its karmic fruit, which could no longer be said to exist, and\nthat which has not issued its fruit, which must be held still to\nexist. The name \u2018Sthaviravada\u2019 is in Pali \u2018Theravada\u2019, and\nTheravadins are indeed happy also to be called \u2018Vibhajjavadins\u2019.\nHowever the Theravadins clearly cannot actually be identical with\nthe Sthaviravadins of this ancient dispute since the traditional\nTheravadin position on dharmas in the three times is that only the\npresent dharma exists (see Kathavatthu 1:6).\nA unique Theravadin doctrine is that of the bhavanga. The\nbhavanga is an inactive level of mind that is still present when no\nmental activity is occurring, as in the case of so-called\n\u2018unconsciousness\u2019, or deep sleep. When e.g. a visual perception\noccurs, the mind emerges from the state of bhavanga and \u2018adverts\u2019\nto the visual object, taking its part in a complex process of\nexperiencing, receiving the data, and possibly investigating the\nobject, determining it, grasping, it, and identifying it. But the\nTheravada view is that at the end of each process of consciousness\nthe mind returns to the state of bhavanga, no matter how short\nthat return may be. The bhavanga is also the level of mind that\nmakes the link between a dying person and the rebirth. When the\ncausal link occurs, and consciousness first arises in the embryo in\nthe womb, that consciousness is the bhavanga, determined by the\nkarmic forces of previous lives. The link between the\nconsciousness of the dying person and that of the rebirth is direct.\nThe Theravada denies that there is any intermediate state\n(antarabhava) between death and rebirth, a theory accepted by",

This point is reflected in the definition of the\ndhamma which occurs in post-canonical Pali texts: \u2018Dhammas are\nso-called because they hold (dharenti) their own-existence\u2019 (Pali:\nsabhava; Sanskrit: svabhava).

Sets up the tension between emptiness seeming unappealing on the surface versus its profound liberating potential. Explains how traditional definitions and explanations of emptiness can be difficult to grasp initially, while acknowledging its richness and complexity as a subject.\nEMPTINESS IS AN ODD TERM for the central philosophy of a world reli\u00ad\ngion. It certainly lacks the emotional appeal of Hinduism\u2019s bliss and devotion, \nfor instance, or Christianity\u2019s love and charity. It is not a word designed to attract \nnewcomers. More than just austere, it sounds a little off-putting. Who would \ngravitate to a way of life based on what sounds like nothingness? \nIn fact, the insights pointed to by emptiness are deeply liberating and bring \ngreat happiness. They transform how we understand ourselves and life in pro\u00ad\nfound ways. Many of those who have practiced the Buddha\u2019s teaching on empti\u00ad\nness regard it as the greatest gift he offered the world. Nonetheless, it is not an \neasy subject to approach. \nWhen I first became interested in the concept of emptiness in Buddhism, I \nread a hefty volume with a respectable pedigree that defined emptiness as \u201cthe \nlack of inherent self-existence.\u201d I didn\u2019t doubt the author, but that definition \ndidn\u2019t mean much to me at the time.

Explores the etymology and meaning of the word \"emptiness\" in Buddhist traditions, particularly its origins in Pali (su\u00f1\u00f1a) and Sanskrit (sh\u016bnya). Explains how emptiness has evolved to have multiple meanings in Buddhism while maintaining its core definition as \"the quality of being empty.\"\n2\u2003\nINTRODUCTION\nMingyur Rinpoche is a bright young Tibetan lama who, not too long ago, \nreturned from a four-year personal retreat wandering the Himalayas. On his \nfirst visit to California in 1998, I had a chance to visit with him and show him \naround Marin County. As we drove I tried to strike up a conversation. \u201cHow \ndo you find the West?\u201d I asked. \u201cSquare and clean,\u201d was his reply. \u201cDo you \nthink Tibetans are happier than Westerners?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d End of conversation.\nWe reached our destination at the top of Mount Tamalpais and were walking \nalong the trail around the summit, an asphalt track about six feet wide, when I \nthought I\u2019d try again. \u201cWhat is the difference between the Dzogchen view and \nthe Madhyamaka view?\u201d I asked, referring to two schools in Tibet that are con\u00ad\nsidered to have different understandings of the nature of reality. \n\u201cAh!\u201d he said, now interested. \u201cTo understand that, you have to understand \nthat there are eighteen different kinds of emptiness!\u201d He sat down on the path \nright where we were and talked animatedly about the two views, concluding by \nsaying something to the effect that the Madhyamikas think that the Dzogchen\u00ad\npas believe that something exists that doesn\u2019t actually exist, but that actually the \nDzogchenpas don\u2019t believe that. Or something like that. The eighteen different \nkinds of emptiness went by quickly, but in any case it was a delight to listen to \nthe young rinpoche.\nI wondered at first if our word emptiness was a weak translation of some lofty \nideal that had many rich overtones in the original ancient dialect, but that turned \nout not to be the case. In Pali, the Indian language in which the earliest teach\u00ad\nings of the Buddha are preserved, the root word is su\u00f1\u00f1a. (Please see the glos\u00ad\nsary for the pronunciation of non-English terms.) The Sanskrit is sh\u016bnya. Both \nwords literally mean \u201cempty.\u201d A line of advice frequently given by the Buddha \nto his disciples was, \u201cThere are these roots of trees, there are these empty huts. \nMeditate now, lest you regret it later.\u201d The word for \u201cempty\u201d here is su\u00f1\u00f1a. As in \nEnglish, it becomes a noun by adding a suffix:  su\u00f1\u00f1at\u0101 (Skt: sh\u016bnyat\u0101), giving us \n\u201cemptiness,\u201d the quality of being empty.\nOver many years the word emptiness has taken on a number of meanings in \nBuddhism. The quality of something being empty is perhaps the simplest mean\u00ad\ning. It is helpful to remember that when a noun is derived from an adjective, as \nemptiness is derived from empty, it doesn\u2019t mean that the noun refers to some\u00ad\nthing that exists independently as an object on its own. It only means the noun is \nWisdom Pubs, Inc. -- Not for Distribution",

Appears in the introduction chapter where the author breaks down the concept of emptiness from simple to more complex interpretations. Explains how emptiness relates to both the absence of self and a quality of mind, setting up key themes that will be explored throughout the book.\nINTRODUCTION\u2003\n3\ndenoting the quality pointed to by that adjective. Just as it is not possible to find \nwetness apart from something that is wet, we don\u2019t expect to find emptiness as \na thing that exists on its own. We could also talk about the roundness of a snow \nglobe or of a pregnant woman\u2019s belly, but we are only saying that the objects are \nround. Emptiness here just means the quality of something being empty, like a \njar, a desert, or the sky. With this meaning, emptiness functions, in a certain way, \nmore like an adjective.\nWhat might be understood as empty and what is it empty of? Let us begin by \nasking what it means to be a human being. Most people imagine that individual \nhuman experience revolves around a self, a notion that appears in our language \nthrough the terms I, me, my, and mine. Prior to careful investigation, we assume \nthat the term I refers to an entity that can be found. The Buddha, however, dis\u00ad\ncerned that our human experience is empty of a self. This is the liberating teach\u00ad\ning of not-self. In this example, emptiness is more or less synonymous with the \nabsence of a \u201cself.\u201d This was one of the early meanings of emptiness in Buddhism.\nLater Buddhist schools used the term emptiness to emphasize the lack of sub\u00ad\nstance in the world. Just as twentieth-century quantum physicists exposed the \nlack of solidity in matter, the Buddha and his followers perceived this directly \nthrough meditation nearly 2,500 years earlier. This lack of substance is pointed \nto in the earliest Buddhist teachings and was explored more fully in succeeding \ncenturies.\nAnother early usage of the word emptiness refers to a refined meditative state \nin which perception is greatly simplified. In a usual moment of experience, \nthe many objects we perceive\u2014sights, sounds, smells, tastes, sensations, and \nimages\u2014lead to thoughts and feelings about them. We hear a person\u2019s voice \nand imagine she is talking about us. We see a treasured possession and dwell on \nhow it came to us. When perception is simplified so that we simply notice, for \nexample, sound or sight, we are able to be present in a balanced and peaceful way. \nThe full development of this approach was described by the Buddha as \u201cabiding \nin emptiness.\u201d\nA more colloquial use of the word emptiness evolved that points to the quality \nof mind when we are in touch with the present moment and not preoccupied \nwith wants, needs, or issues of past or future. This mind is said to be empty in that \nit is not filled with extraneous thinking. Such a mind is attuned to the present \nWisdom Pubs, Inc. -- Not for Distribution",

Explains how emptiness relates to impermanence and our tendency to cling to things for security. Discusses how understanding emptiness can lead to greater acceptance of change and freedom from suffering.\n4\u2003\nINTRODUCTION\nwith openness and receptivity. An empty mind moves easily to joy and con\u00ad\ntentment and moves slowly to reactive emotions like fear and anger. We might \nunderstand this as a less refined, everyday example of \u201cabiding in emptiness.\u201d\nThere is a common misunderstanding about emptiness that I would like to \ndispel as we begin. Emptiness does not mean vacancy, nothingness, or the absence \nof conscious experience. As we\u2019ve seen, emptiness is a property or characteristic \nof things that appear in the world. It is found within our human, conscious expe\u00ad\nrience. There is a subtle meditative state called \u201cthe base of nothingness,\u201d which \ndenotes an absence of sense contact. It is a significant achievement in concentra\u00ad\ntion, but it does not bear in a central way on the meaning of emptiness as pre\u00ad\nsented here. For the purposes of this book, emptiness is primarily understood as \na property of things that appear in our world. Understanding emptiness brings \nfreedom to our experience as we live consciously in the world. \nNotwithstanding these definitions of emptiness or the eighteen kinds that Min\u00ad\ngyur Rinpoche pointed to, we might say, simply, that emptiness means that the \nthings of this world, including me, are not truly solid or substantial. In the begin\u00ad\nning we are mostly unaware of the solidity we attribute to our self and the rest \nof the world, so even this description requires investigation. In fact all the defini\u00ad\ntions of emptiness have broad implications, because they go against fundamental \nassumptions we have of ourselves and the world, assumptions so pervasive and \nunexamined that we hardly know they are assumptions at all. Here is a brief sum\u00ad\nmation of some of these implications.\nWe hold on tightly to things in an attempt to find security, but because the \nworld is always in flux, this effort is ultimately unsuccessful. The thing we\u2019ve \nclung to changes, and the clinging to what no longer is becomes a source of frus\u00ad\ntration and insecurity. Clearly seeing the fact of impermanence undermines our \ntendency to hold on, because we recognize that things will inevitably change. \nAs we get older, for example, if we continue to wish that our bodies would stay \nas they were when we were twenty, we will suffer with every new wrinkle and \npound. When we understand that change is inherent in the nature of the physi\u00ad\ncal body, we can be much more graceful in accepting the aging process.\nSeeing emptiness acknowledges this and takes it a step further. We also see \nthat there was nothing solid to hold on to in the first place. It is not actually \nWisdom Pubs, Inc. -- Not for Distribution",

All that we can cling to is the memory of \nsomething fleeting. We understand, for example, that aging is going on in our \nbodies even at the cellular level. If cells are constantly dying and being recreated, \nhow can our skin be expected to be constant for even one year? Moreover, within \nmost cells, rapid chemical interactions are constant, as mitochondria burn the \nnutrients delivered to them. These bodily processes cannot be stopped or frozen \neven for a second.\nWhen we see that this is true in every facet of life, it changes us deeply. We \nbecome less bound to the past and able to live more in the present. The heart can \nlet go of what it has tried to store up. This shift comes as a great relief. We feel \nlighter, freer, and happier.\nWe explore emptiness not to construct another ideology but to bring greater \nfreedom and contentment into our lives. The aim of all the Buddha\u2019s teachings \nis to convey a path out of suffering in all its many forms and into the greatest \npossible freedom, which he called nibb\u0101na.

After the Buddha\u2019s death (ca. 400 b.c.e.) some philosophical \ndisagreements emerged, and over the next few hundred years, the Sangha splin\u00ad\ntered into about eighteen schools, including the modern tradition we know as \nTheravada, \u201cthe way of the elders.\u201d I will refer to these eighteen as the schools of \nEarly Buddhism. Despite their differences, the eighteen schools all agreed on the \ncentral teachings of the historical Buddha, which emphasized the emptiness of \nour conditioned notion of self.\nThe Mahayana (\u201cgreat vehicle\u201d) schools emerged around 100 b.c.e.\u2013250 c.e. \nbased primarily on the Perfection of Wisdom texts (Skt: Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 Sutras) \nand the works of a teacher named N\u0101g\u0101rjuna. The teachings of these schools \nemphasized the emptiness of all phenomena, that is, the emptiness of objects as \nwell as of self.\nThe Yog\u0101c\u0101ra (\u201cpractice of yoga\u201d) school, a branch of the Mahayana founded \nabout 350 c.e., looked closely into the nature of awareness itself and found that \nit too was characterized by emptiness. This understanding became the basis for \nmany later schools of meditation.\nThe first three sections of the book correspond to the emphases of those three \nschools. The fourth section of the book, Compassion, is relevant for all Bud\u00ad\ndhist schools\u2014and indeed to anyone looking to live a life guided by kindness \nand wisdom.\nSupportive Tools and Practices\nThe Buddha\u2019s teachings are called the Dharma, a term that means \u201ctruth\u201d or \n\u201claw\u201d or \u201cthe way things are.\u201d Traditionally there are three avenues to learning \nthe Dharma based on what activity the understanding springs from.2 These three \navenues generally have differing degrees of power in their ability to transform us.\n\t 1.\tUnderstanding from hearing. This learning comes from hearing someone \ntalk about the way things are or, in the modern day, reading about it. \nThis gives us new information and leads to a certain kind of conceptual \nknowledge, but its effect is usually limited.\n\t 2.\tUnderstanding from reflection.

We are still in the thinking realm, but we\u2019re reflecting under our \nown guidance in a way that feels new and direct. We might say that the \nfirst two avenues fall under the approach of rational inquiry.\n\t 3.\tUnderstanding from meditative insight. This way of learning occurs \nthrough the arising of an intuition that reveals a new way of seeing the \nworld. While meditative insight will eventually express itself in words, it \nfirst emerges as a flash of pure seeing. Insight is essentially nonconceptual \nand has the greatest power to transform us. The primary style of medi\u00ad\ntation taught in classical Buddhism is called insight meditation (Pali: \nvipassan\u0101) because of its emphasis on this third kind of understanding. \nMeditative insight can\u2019t be willed, ordered, forced, or commanded. It \nblazes forth when the conditions are right. An essential part of condi\u00ad\ntions being right is that we have previously seeded the ground with the \ntwo avenues of rational inquiry: hearing (or reading) and reflection. \nMeditation then adds the qualities of stillness and presence, which lead \nto fresh and creative ways of understanding. When the time is right, in\u00ad\nsight arises as this third kind of learning.\nIn a public talk a few years ago the Dalai Lama explained succinctly how these \nthree avenues work together. He quoted an old Tibetan master talking about \nhis own practice: \u201cWhen I meditate, I bring to bear my study and critical reflec\u00ad\ntion. When I study, I bring to bear my meditation and critical reflection. When \nI reflect, I bring to bear my study and meditation.\u201d3\nWe need all three avenues of learning to fully understand the truth of empti\u00ad\nness. This book can itself be a source for study, and I will also recommend other \nreadings. In these pages you will find some reflections to carry out on your own. \nYou will probably form your own ideas and questions to consider further. Reflec\u00ad\ntion will greatly strengthen your confidence in your understanding and lead \nonward to insight.\nSome of the explorations in the book will be most accessible to those who \nalready have a Buddhist meditation practice. We encourage you to take up a \nmeditation practice, if you haven\u2019t already, that will foster the kind of intuitive \nrealizations that can most deeply free the heart and mind.

Most of \nus find that new understandings keep coming over a lifetime of study, reflection, \nand meditation. With them comes an ever-growing sense of freedom and ease \nin life, as well as more heartfelt connections with other people, creatures, and \nphysical nature. The entire process, which we might describe as the awakening of \nwisdom, is possible only because of the vast, inherent richness of your heart and \nmind. If you sincerely want to understand, and you pose the right questions in \na sustained way, the mind with its profound intuitive powers will respond with \nwisdom and insight. The keys that unlock the mysteries are observation, inquiry, \nand reflection.\nA Note on Sources\nAmong the eighteen schools of Early Buddhism, each had its own canon of \ntexts that included monastic rules, discourses of the Buddha, and a psycho\u00ad\nlogical schema. From all these schools only one entire canon has survived to \nthe present day, that of the Theravada School. It has come down to us in Pali, \na language of ancient India similar to Sanskrit. Much of the Pali Canon is pur\u00ad\nported to be the authentic words of Gotama Buddha from almost 2,500 years \nago. While this is impossible to verify, recent work comparing these texts with \nfragments of other canons found in China and Tibet support the view that the \nPali Canon does include the essential components of the Buddha\u2019s teachings \nfrom his lifetime.\nIn this book I will use the texts of the Pali Canon for quotations attributed \nto the Buddha. When a phrase appears here such as, \u201cthe Buddha said,\u201d it means \nthat such a statement can be found in the Pali Canon as representing the words \nof Gotama Buddha. While errors have certainly crept into these texts over the \nyears, I take the discourses (Pali: suttas) of the Pali Canon to be as complete \nand reliable a guide to the teachings of the historical Buddha as can be found today.\nIn Mahayana texts like the Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 Sutras, statements are often pre\u00ad\nsented as having been spoken by the Buddha himself during his lifetime.

Discusses the authorship and historical context of Mahayana texts versus original Buddhist discourses. Details the challenges of translating Pali and Sanskrit terms into English and the author's approach to maintaining precision while making the concepts accessible to Western readers.\nINTRODUCTION\u2003\n9\nthese statements represent deep spiritual wisdom. As to their authorship, how\u00ad\never, I follow Edward Conze, a scholar who translated many of these texts into \nEnglish, in his assertion that the Mahayana texts were created by other authors \nhundreds of years after the Buddha\u2019s death.5 The consensus among Western \nscholars agrees with this assessment. Conze suggests that the words were put \ninto the mouth of the Buddha to give the later texts the same authenticity as the \noriginal discourses.\nSimilarly, it is clear that N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s works and the key texts of the Yogacarins \nwere created long after the Buddha\u2019s time. This does not make them any less pow\u00ad\nerful or diminish their value for the sincere practitioner, but it can be helpful to \nrecall that they are not the actual words of Gotama Buddha.\nA Note on Terms\nThe ancient languages of Pali and Sanskrit were very precise in their descrip\u00ad\ntions of the human mind and meditative experience, much more so than English \nis today. Western culture unfortunately has little understanding of many of the \nstates that the Buddha was pointing to. We can expect that over decades some \nof the ancient words will migrate into English, as they have into modern Thai \nand Burmese\u2014though we are not there yet (notwithstanding a perfume named \nSamsara, and the like).\nGood translations are helping us read more accurately in English what the \nBuddha meant. I will generally try to use a single English word throughout this \nwork to translate a single Pali word so that we can develop a more precise English \nvocabulary for these teachings. Unfortunately, sometimes the full meaning of a \nPali word cannot be adequately conveyed by one English word. For example, the \nPali term dukkha is usually translated as \u201csuffering,\u201d but it actually indicates the \nentire range of the uncomfortable experiences in life, from intense suffering to \npervasive insecurity to mild discontent. Other English words bring in connota\u00ad\ntions that are not present in the original Pali term and so can be misleading for \nEnglish speakers. For example, \u201cconcentration\u201d is the generally accepted transla\u00ad\ntion of the Pali sam\u0101dhi. However, concentration connotes an exclusive focus \nof attention, a sense that is not present in sam\u0101dhi. An English speaker who \nwishes to understand the Dharma will still benefit from learning some of the \nclassical terms.\nWisdom Pubs, Inc. -- Not for Distribution",

There is no way to a true and lasting happiness without \nseeing into and eventually overcoming this force.\nFortunately Buddhism doesn\u2019t stop with the diagnosis. It offers a radical \ntherapy for overcoming self-centeredness by questioning the very idea of a self. \nThroughout his teaching career, the Buddha returned to this point again and \nagain. He said that in our obsession with self, we are like a barking dog tied to a \npost, running endlessly and fruitlessly around a single point,2 yet we fundamen\u00ad\ntally misunderstand what it is. \u201cIn whatever way they conceive of self,\u201d he said, \n\u201cthe fact is ever other than that.\u201d3\nTHE LANGUAGE OF SELF AND NOT-SELF\nAs we\u2019ve seen, the self is designated by words like I, me, and mine. This sense of \nself, or \u201cI,\u201d seems unmistakably real, yet when we look for it directly, it is elusive. \nWilliam James said, \u201cWhen I search for my self, all I can find is a funny feeling \nat the back of my throat.\u201d The Dalai Lama said that when something seems clear \nto us but we can\u2019t find it, that is a sure sign of delusion. The self is not real in the \nways we take it to be.\nThe Buddha was asked by his cousin and longtime attendant, \u0100nanda, \u201cVen\u00ad\nerable sir, it is said, \u2018Empty is the world, empty is the world.\u2019 In what way is it said, \n\u2018Empty is the world\u2019?\u201d The Buddha replied, \u201cIt is, \u0100nanda, because it is empty of \nself and of what belongs to self that it is said, \u2018Empty is the world.\u2019\u201d4\nThe world is empty of self. Sometimes this is explained as the Buddhist \nteaching of no-self. Yet it seems inarguable that someone has written these \nwords and someone else is reading them! What is the meaning of the puzzling \nassertion of no-self? This is the question I\u2019ll try to answer in part 1 of this book. \nTo the extent that we can intuit the absence of a self, as opposed to merely \nbelieving in it as a doctrine, we will understand a key aspect of emptiness.

The Buddha did not tell us never to say these words in any type of con\u00ad\nversation. He said that a wise person can use these terms without being confused \nby them.5 Our speech would sound absurd if we did not use the words I or mine \nout of a fear of being \u201cdharmically incorrect.\u201d We\u2019d have to resort to cumbersome \nexpressions like \u201cthe speaker\u201d or \u201cthe one standing here.\u201d\nIt\u2019s fine to say \u201cI\u201d and \u201cmine,\u201d \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyours,\u201d as long you understand that \nthese terms are merely conventions of our social contract that identify where an \nactivity is taking place or where ownership is assigned. With these useful con\u00ad\nventions, you end up in your home and I end up in mine, after driving our respec\u00ad\ntive cars. Life would be too chaotic without these conventions and the language \nwe use to communicate about them.\nSimilarly, there is a conventional manner in which we can talk about an indi\u00ad\nvidual having a unique way of being that we might call an identity. We all have \ncharacteristics of height, weight, age, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orien\u00ad\ntation, and personality that allow us to describe ourselves in meaningful and \nauthentic ways. The teaching on the absence of self does not take away or disre\u00ad\ngard these useful forms of description. But it does point to the need not to stop \nat the conventional description and take it as an ultimate truth\u2014because doing \nthat will lead to suffering.\nThe problem arises when we take conventional language to mean more than it \ncan. By repeating \u201cI\u201d and \u201cmine,\u201d and describing ourselves as being a certain way, \nwe\u2019ve come to believe that something real is being pointed to that isn\u2019t actually \nthere. Buddhist practice helps us free ourselves from this delusion and see things \nas they actually are. In the process we find a more expansive and generous way to \nrelate with the world.\nNo-Self versus Not-Self\nThere is a debate in the Western Buddhist world on how to translate this key \nteaching on the absence of self. Some teachers call it \u201cno-self \u201d and others call it \n\u201cnot-self.\u201d The Pali term is anatt\u0101 and could be translated either way: att\u0101 means \n\u201cself \u201d and the prefix an- is a negation. Those who translate it as \u201cno-self \u201d say this \nis a pithy expression that directly points to the insight that the world is empty of \nself, that no self can found anywhere. Those who call it \u201cnot-self \u201d are fond of say\u00ad\ning (and as far as I know, this is true) that there is no passage in the Pali Canon in \nWisdom Pubs, Inc. -- Not for Distribution",

Philosophi\u00ad\ncally, saying \u201cthe world is empty of self \u201d is a clear statement of absence, and so \nI believe the translation \u201cno-self \u201d is a valid interpretation. However, the most \ncompelling argument for using \u201cnot-self,\u201d I find, is that it shifts the discussion \nfrom a philosophical position (\u201cThere is no self \u201d) to a point-by-point investi\u00ad\ngation of one\u2019s direct experience (\u201cThe body is not the self \u201d). A philosophical \nposition can be taken as something we ought to believe, and if we don\u2019t we\u2019re not \ngood Buddhists.\nBuddhism is not particularly concerned with beliefs, because beliefs don\u2019t lib\u00ad\nerate us. The Buddha was interested in having us develop understanding to lead \nus out of suffering.

It can feel as though there\u2019s a small entity located inside the \nhead, a couple inches behind the eyes. This being is the center of everything; it \nwatches sights, hears sounds, smells odors, thinks thoughts, and feels emotions. \nThis \u201cI\u201d seems to stay the same over time through many changing experiences.

It feels \nas though this observing \u201cI\u201d was with us in grade school, is here today, and will \nbe a couple of inches behind our eyes until we die.\nThe identification here as the observer is, in reality, taking as \u201cI\u201d the activity of \nconsciousness, the faculty of mind that receives or knows the sense impressions \nWisdom Pubs, Inc. -- Not for Distribution",

We imag\u00ad\nine the \u201cI\u201d wakes up each morning, eats breakfast, goes to work, comes home, \neats dinner, and then goes to sleep. This \u201cI\u201d was born from our mother\u2019s womb \nand at some point will die from illness or injury. \nBecause we cherish the self, we find it frightening to consider that it will end \nat death. The anxiety we feel around our mortality is sometimes mild (if we are \nyoung and healthy) and sometimes acute (if we are old or ill\u2014or Woody Allen). \nThe assumption of continuity necessarily leads to the fear of death and thus \ninvolves some degree of suffering. \nOf course there is some kind of continuity when a being exists over a span of \nyears, but when we look closely, can we find a single thing that endures?

This may begin when \nwe are young as simply the way English grammar works, but when we tell stories \nlike this for twenty or thirty years, it comes to represent reality for us and not just \na convention of language.\nMy first year meditating, I practiced a kind of insight meditation based on \na body scan. In this approach one systematically moves the attention through \nevery area of the body, focusing for a while on each part and simply feeling \nwithout judgment the sensations (or absence of sensations) that are present. I \nsometimes engaged in this practice for ten hours a day several weeks at a time. I \nhad ample time to investigate the details of every nook and cranny of the body, \nand I never found an observer anywhere. Later meditations showed that there is \nno such center to our experience. This \u201cobserver\u201d is only a concept, an assump\u00ad\ntion not borne out in reality. There is no \u201cI\u201d standing apart from our experiences.\nJ. Krishnamurti, the Indian philosopher and sage of the last century, was \nfond of saying, \u201cThe observer is the observed.\u201d2 This can be interpreted in a few \nways, not all of which are accurate, so for our purposes I might paraphrase it as, \n\u201cThe observer does not exist apart from the observed,\u201d or \u201cWhile observing, the \nobserver is made up in part by that which is observed.\u201d When we are observing \nanger, we are, at least in part, that anger. When we are observing love, we are that \nlove. What is in our experience is in us. We do not stand apart from the experience. \nWhen we think that what we really are is separate from what we experience, \nwe create an auxiliary entity that doesn\u2019t exist. We have to keep creating this \u201cI\u201d \nover and over to sustain the fiction of its reality. This requires constant effort that \nprevents the heart and mind from ever fully relaxing. Moreover, the identifica\u00ad\ntion with this entity that stands apart leads to a detached relationship with our \nexperience that prevents us from feeling fully alive.\nControl\nWe believe that the self can exert a considerable degree of control over at least \nthis body and mind, and we sometimes wish that the control could extend to \nWisdom Pubs, Inc. -- Not for Distribution",

Many of the tantrums of a two-year-old are due to the \nfrustration of this attempt to control the world. Our tantrums as adults are not \nso different.\nSometimes illness is felt as a great insult, because we see that we are not able to \ncontrol even our own body. The Buddha was once challenged in debate by Sac\u00ad\ncaka, a follower of Jainism who vowed to refute the teaching of not-self. In reply \nthe Buddha asked Saccaka if his body (here called material form) was under his \ncontrol: \u201cWhen you say thus: \u2018Material form is my self,\u2019 do you exercise any such \npower over that material form as to say, \u2018Let my form be thus; let my form not \nbe thus?\u2019\u201d3 When Saccaka would not answer, so the story goes, a spirit appeared \nabove him holding a thunderbolt, ready to split the Jain\u2019s head in two. Saccaka \nfinally agreed that he could not control his body and so could not actually regard \nit as his self. His head was spared.\nWe can discover this same lack of control any time we feel embarrassed about \nour body. How often have we felt ashamed that we aren\u2019t better looking or taller \nor finer boned or more athletic? Yet all these characteristics are beyond our choice \nor control. If we take responsibility for them, we have fallen under the false belief \nof controllability. This element of control also explains why for many people, \nthe hardest place to accept the truth of not-self is in the area of volition or deci\u00ad\nsion making. Surely if a decision is being made, we reason, there must be a decider, \na controlling agent or entity. \nSingleness\nThe fourth assumption behind the notion of a self is that it is a single, unitary \nthing\u2014not plural or manifold. Generally speaking, each of us feels that we are \none person, not two or three or more. Those who believe otherwise are quickly \nmedicated. Moreover, we believe this one person is unique in the world, perhaps \nin the whole universe.\nWhen we take ourselves to be the body, the owner of the body, the mind, the \nowner of the mind, and the observer, we are trying to be many different things: \neye, consciousness, liver, compassion, toenail, thoughts, anger. This might be all \nright if we feel that we are constantly coming and going, as all these things do by \ntheir nature of impermanence. But we combine the belief in singleness with the \nassumption of continuity. Is there an object that meets both these criteria?\nWisdom Pubs, Inc. -- Not for Distribution",

We must now ask if these six ways align with the four assumptions about \nthe self: continuity, independence, control, and singleness. If a way of identifica\u00ad\ntion with our experience is not in alignment with an assumption about the self, \nthen we cannot accept it as a valid definition of the self.\nThe body might appear to continue, but close inspection reveals constant \nchange, aging, and eventual death and decay. It lacks independence, as it is built \nfrom air, food, and water. It is clearly out of our control, as even Saccaka attested. \nAnd it is not a single thing but a collection of manifold, quite dissimilar parts.\nEmotions have even less continuity than the body, often changing by the \nhour. They generally arise in response to the immediate situation or a memory, \nso they are not wholly independent phenomena. Most of us are vulnerable to \nfear, anger, and jealousy, and so cannot control our emotions. Many different \nemotions come and go, so there is no singleness here.\nThe owner of the body, the owner of the emotions, and the observer cannot \nbe clearly found, thus violating the assumption of stable continuity. Nor is the \nsupposed owner or observer able to exert the desired control of experience. The \nowner or observer may feel to be independent and single, but if they cannot be \nlocated, we have to conclude that there is no owner or observer there.\nThe self as the assemblage of all the aspects of body, mind, owner, and observer \nis the notion most of us carry, but it fails all the assumptions: the assemblage \nchanges moment by moment, is dependent because it is affected by outside con\u00ad\nditions, is not in our control, and is not unitary but many different things.\nThrough this analysis we see that all our usual ways of identifying\u2014of defin\u00ad\ning the \u201cI\u201d\u2014don\u2019t quite make sense. How is it then that we keep having such a \nfirm sense that this \u201cI\u201d is real? To see how this happens, we can start by looking \nclose to home, in our direct moment-to-moment experience of body and mind. \nThis examination takes us into the territory of meditation, so we will continue \nwith simple instructions on mindfulness of body sensations and emotions.\nWisdom Pubs, Inc. -- Not for Distribution",

Once you have connected to the experience of breathing \nin and out, then move your attention to notice other sensations in the \nbody. For example, you might notice the touch of your palms against \neach other or your clothes, or the pressure where your buttocks rest \non the chair or cushion, or some tension around the eyes or shoulders, \nor the beating of your heart in the chest.\nLet the attention go wherever it is drawn in the body. When you no\u00ad\ntice a new sensation, just feel its physical nature in the body. It might be \npulsing, tingling, vibrating, warm, cool, pressure, or lightness. It might \nbe pleasant or uncomfortable. All of these are fine. Mindfulness knows \nthe experience by feeling the sensation in the body, just as it is. You \ndon\u2019t need to judge or change anything. Just know what it is you\u2019re \nexperiencing.\nMindfulness of Emotions\nAs you\u2019re paying attention to the breath or to sensations, you might \nsometimes notice that you\u2019re feeling some mood or emotion. It could \nbe sadness or anxiety, happiness or irritation, affection or dislike. When \nyou notice a mood or an emotion, let the attention stay with that expe\u00ad\nrience for a while. Allow yourself simply to feel that mood or emotion.\nIt is helpful to name the emotion you feel: anger, joy, contentment, \nand so on. You don\u2019t need to judge the mood or emotion or to change \nit. When you feel the emotion directly and know what you\u2019re feeling, \nthis is mindfulness of emotions.\nWisdom Pubs, Inc. -- Not for Distribution",

Explains how material and immaterial aspects, along with perceptions and consciousness, are neither truly existent nor non-existent. Culminates in the understanding that transcending these illusions leads to freedom from suffering and the attainment of Nirvana.\nThe Heart Sutra in English \n  Translated by Gerhard Herzog \n  \n   \n  \nWhen the holy Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara had truly grasped the transcendent \nwisdom, he realized that visible form is only illusion. The same applies to its \nperception, to its names and categories, to discriminative intellect and finally \neven to our consciousness. They are all illusion. With this realizaton he was \nbeyond all sorrow and bitterness.  \nDisciple Sariputra! The material is not different from the immaterial. The \nimmaterial and the material are in fact one and the same thing. The same \napplies to perception, concepts, discriminative thinking and consciousness. \nThey are neither existing nor not existing.  \nSariputra! All things therefore they are in themselves not good and not bad, \nthey are not increasing and not decreasing.  \nTherefore one may say there are no such things as form, perception, concepts, \nthinking process, and consciousness. Our senses such as eye, ear, nose, tongue, \nbody and mind are misleading us to illusion; thus one may also say there is no \nreality in visible form, sound, smell, taste, touch and mindknowledge. There are \nalso no such things as the realms of sense from sight up to mind, and no such \nthings as the links of existence from ignorance and its end to old age and death \nand their end. Also the Four Noble Truths* are nonexistent, just as there is no \nsuch thing as wisdom and also no gain.  \nBecause the holy Bodhisattva who relies on transcendent wisdom knows that \nthere is no gain, he has no worries and also no fear. Beyond all illusion he has \nreached the space of highest Nirvana.",

Describes how these states represent ideal conduct towards living beings and their role in promoting social harmony and peace.

They provide, in fact,\nthe answer to all situations arising from social contact. They\nare the great removers of tension, the great peace-makers in\nsocial conflict, and the great healers of wounds suffered in\nthe struggle of existence. They level social barriers, build\nharmonious communities, awaken slumbering\nmagnanimity long forgotten, revive joy and hope long\nabandoned, and promote human brotherhood against the\nforces of egotism.\nThe Brahma-vih\u0101ras are incompatible with a hating state of\nmind, and in that they are akin to Brahm\u0101, the divine but\ntransient ruler of the higher heavens in the traditional\nBuddhist picture of the universe. In contrast to many other\nconceptions of deities, East and West, who by their own\ndevotees are said to show anger, wrath, jealousy, and\n\u201crighteous indignation,\u201d Brahm\u0101 is free from hate; and one\nwho assiduously develops these four sublime states, by\nconduct and meditation, is said to become an equal of\nBrahm\u0101 (brahma-samo). If they become the dominant\ninfluence in one\u2019s mind, one will be reborn in congenial\nworlds, the realms of Brahm\u0101. Therefore these states of\nmind are called god-like, Brahma-like.\n5",

But most people have their eyes and ears\nclosed. They do not see the unbroken stream of tears\nflowing through life; they do not hear the cry of distress\ncontinually pervading the world. Their own little grief or\njoy bars their sight, deafens their ears. Bound by selfishness,\ntheir hearts turn stiff and narrow. Being stiff and narrow,\nhow should they be able to strive for any higher goal, to\nrealize that only release from selfish craving will effect their\nown freedom from suffering?\nIt is compassion that removes the heavy bar, opens the door\nto freedom, makes the narrow heart as wide as the world.\nCompassion takes away from the heart the inert weight, the\nparalyzing heaviness; it gives wings to those who cling to\nthe lowlands of self.\nThrough compassion the fact of suffering remains vividly\npresent to our mind, even at times when we personally are\nfree from it. It gives us the rich experience of suffering, thus\nstrengthening us to meet it prepared when it does befall us.\nCompassion reconciles us to our own destiny by showing us\nthe lives of others, often much harder than ours.\nBehold the endless caravan of beings, men and beasts,\nburdened with sorrow and pain! The burden of every one of\nthem, we also have carried in bygone times during the\nunfathomable sequence of repeated births. Behold this, and\n15",

After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to\nthe dwelling of Ka\u0304\u1e37akhemaka the Sakyan for the day\u2019s meditation.\nNow at that time many resting places had been spread out at Ka\u0304\u1e37akhemaka\u2019s dwelling. The Buddha saw\nthis, and wondered, \u201cMany resting places have been spread out; are there many mendicants living\nhere?\u201d\nNow at that time Venerable \u0100nanda, together with many other mendicants, was making robes in\nGha\u1e6da the Sakyan\u2019s dwelling. Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to\nGha\u1e6da\u2019s dwelling, where he sat on the seat spread out and said to Venerable \u0100nanda, \u201cMany resting\nplaces have been spread out at K\u0101\u1e37akhemaka\u2019s dwelling; are many mendicants living there?\u201d\n\u201cIndeed there are, sir. It\u2019s currently the time for making robes.\u201d\n\u201c\u0100nanda, a mendicant doesn\u2019t shine who enjoys company and groups, who loves them and likes to\nenjoy them. It\u2019s quite impossible that such a mendicant will get the pleasure of renunciation, the plea\u2010\nsure of seclusion, the pleasure of peace, the pleasure of awakening when they want, without trouble\nor difficulty. But you should expect that a mendicant who lives alone, withdrawn from the group, will\nget the pleasure of renunciation, the pleasure of seclusion, the pleasure of peace, the pleasure of\nawakening when they want, without trouble or difficulty. That is possible.\nIndeed, \u0100nanda, it is quite impossible that a mendicant who enjoys company will enter and remain in\nthe freedom of heart\u2014either that which is temporary and pleasant, or that which is irreversible and\nunshakable. But it is possible that a mendicant who lives alone, withdrawn from the group will enter\nand remain in the freedom of heart\u2014either that which is temporary and pleasant, or that which is\nirreversible and unshakable.\n\u0100nanda, I do not see even a single sight which, with its decay and perishing, would not give rise to sor\u2010\nrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress in someone who has desire and lust for it.",

Compassion is one of the four brahma-vih\u0101ras (divine abodes) along with loving-kindness (mett\u0101), \nsympathetic joy (mudit\u0101), and equanimity (upekkh\u0101). \n \n2. It is seen as the wish for all beings to be free from suffering. \n \n3. Compassion is cultivated through meditation practices like the karu\u1e47\u0101 bh\u0101van\u0101. \n \n4. While important, compassion is generally not emphasized as much as wisdom (pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101) in the path to \nliberation. \n \n5. The ideal of the arahant (fully awakened being) embodies compassion, but it's not typically described \nas the primary motivation for practice. \n \nIn Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism: \n \n1. Compassion is often paired with wisdom (praj\u00f1\u0101) as the two wings of enlightenment. \n \n2. The bodhisattva ideal places great emphasis on compassion, with bodhisattvas vowing to liberate all \nbeings from suffering. \n \n3. Compassion is seen as not just a feeling, but an active force for alleviating suffering. \n \n4. The concept of \"great compassion\" (mah\u0101karu\u1e47\u0101) is developed, which is said to be the compassion \nof a buddha. \n \n5. Practices like tonglen (giving and taking) in Tibetan Buddhism are specifically designed to cultivate \ncompassion. \n \nA key difference is illustrated in the Visuddhimagga, a Therav\u0101da text, which states: \n \n\"By practicing loving-kindness, enmity is abandoned; by practicing compassion, harming is abandoned; \nby practicing sympathetic joy, discontent is abandoned; by practicing equanimity, sensual greed is \nabandoned.\" (Vsm IX.110) \n \nThis shows a more specific, targeted approach to compassion in Therav\u0101da. \n \nIn contrast, the Mah\u0101y\u0101na text Bodhicary\u0101vat\u0101ra by \u015a\u0101ntideva emphasizes the all-encompassing nature \nof compassion: \n \n\"May I be a protector for those without one, \nA guide for all travelers on the way; \nMay I be a bridge, a boat and a ship \nFor all who wish to cross (the water).\" (3:18)",

The Therav\u0101da approach to emptiness is generally more focused on direct experiential insight rather \nthan philosophical elaboration. \n \n4. Key suttas that discuss emptiness include the C\u016b\u1e37asu\u00f1\u00f1ata Sutta (MN 121) and the Mah\u0101su\u00f1\u00f1ata \nSutta (MN 122) in the Majjhima Nik\u0101ya. \n \nIn Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism: \n \n1. Emptiness is a central philosophical concept, especially in the Madhyamaka school founded by \nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna. \n \n2. It's understood as the lack of inherent existence in all phenomena, including both the self and \nexternal objects. \n \n3. Emptiness is often paired with dependent origination (prat\u012btyasamutp\u0101da) to explain the nature of \nreality. \n \n4. The Heart Sutra, a key Mah\u0101y\u0101na text, famously declares \"Form is emptiness, emptiness is form.\" \n \n5. In some Mah\u0101y\u0101na schools, emptiness is equated with the concept of Buddha-nature or \nTath\u0101gatagarbha. \n \nThe Therav\u0101da understanding of emptiness can be seen in the C\u016b\u1e37asu\u00f1\u00f1ata Sutta (MN 121): \n \n\"This is empty of self or of what belongs to self.\" \n \nIn contrast, the Mah\u0101y\u0101na view is exemplified in N\u0101g\u0101rjuna's M\u016blamadhyamakak\u0101rik\u0101: \n \n\"Whatever is dependently co-arisen,  \nThat is explained to be emptiness.  \nThat, being a dependent designation,  \nIs itself the middle way.\" (24:18) \n \nWhile both traditions acknowledge emptiness, Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism tends to place it at the center of its \nphilosophical and soteriological framework, developing extensive philosophical systems around it. \nTherav\u0101da Buddhism, while recognizing the importance of emptiness, generally focuses more on its \npractical application in meditation and the realization of non-self.",

Let me outline the key \naspects of each: \n \nTherav\u0101da Buddhism: \n \n1. Nibb\u0101na (Sanskrit: Nirv\u0101\u1e47a): The ultimate goal is the complete cessation of suffering and the end of \nthe cycle of rebirth (sa\u1e43s\u0101ra). \n \n2. Arahantship: The enlightened being is called an Arahant, who has eradicated all defilements (kilesas) \nand attained liberation. \n \n3. Four stages of enlightenment: Sot\u0101panna (stream-enterer), Sakad\u0101g\u0101m\u012b (once-returner), An\u0101g\u0101m\u012b \n(non-returner), and Arahant. \n \n4. Emphasis on individual liberation: The focus is on personal enlightenment through one's own efforts. \n \n5. Direct insight: Enlightenment is achieved through direct insight into the three characteristics of \nexistence: impermanence (anicca), suffering (dukkha), and non-self (anatt\u0101). \n \nThe Therav\u0101da view is reflected in the Dhammapada: \n \n\"The cessation of desire, of hatred and of delusion: this indeed is called Nibb\u0101na.\" (Dhp 202) \n \nMah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism: \n \n1. Buddhahood: The ultimate goal is to become a fully enlightened Buddha for the benefit of all sentient \nbeings. \n \n2. Bodhisattva path: Emphasis on the bodhisattva ideal, where one vows to attain enlightenment for the \nsake of all beings. \n \n3. Buddha-nature: The concept that all beings possess the innate potential for enlightenment. \n \n4. Two-fold emptiness: Realization of the emptiness of self and phenomena (\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101). \n \n5. Non-duality: Enlightenment involves transcending dualistic thinking and realizing the non-dual nature \nof reality. \n \n6. Multiple bodies of the Buddha: Trik\u0101ya doctrine - Dharmak\u0101ya (truth body), Sambhogak\u0101ya \n(enjoyment body), and Nirm\u0101\u1e47ak\u0101ya (emanation body). \n \nThe Mah\u0101y\u0101na perspective is exemplified in the Heart Sutra: \n \n\"Form is emptiness, emptiness is form. ... There is no attainment, with nothing to attain.\" \n \nKey differences: \n \n1. Scope: Therav\u0101da focuses on individual liberation, while Mah\u0101y\u0101na emphasizes universal liberation. \n \n2.

Both traditions agree on the role of craving in suffering and its necessity to overcome for liberation.\nThis is an insightful question that touches on some key differences in how craving (ta\u1e47h\u0101 in Pali) is \nunderstood in different Buddhist traditions. Let's explore these two perspectives: \n \n1. Craving as attachment to inherent existence: \n \nThis view is more prominent in Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism, particularly in Madhyamaka philosophy. Here, \ncraving is seen as fundamentally rooted in our misconception of reality. \n \nThe Madhyamaka school, founded by N\u0101g\u0101rjuna, emphasizes the concept of \u015b\u016bnyat\u0101 (emptiness). \nAccording to this view, all phenomena lack inherent existence (svabh\u0101va). Our craving and suffering \narise because we mistakenly believe that things (including ourselves) have an intrinsic, independent \nnature. \n \nIn the M\u016blamadhyamakak\u0101rik\u0101, N\u0101g\u0101rjuna states: \n \n\"Whatever is dependently co-arisen \nThat is explained to be emptiness. \nThat, being a dependent designation, \nIs itself the middle way.\" \n \nFrom this perspective, craving is the result of our fundamental ignorance (avidy\u0101) of the empty nature of \nall phenomena. We crave because we mistakenly believe in the inherent existence of objects of desire, \nof a permanent self that can possess them, and of the pleasure we think they can provide. \n \n2. Craving as desire for sensual pleasure and existence: \n \nThis understanding is more prominent in Therav\u0101da Buddhism and aligns closely with the Buddha's \nteachings in the Pali Canon. Here, craving is often categorized into three types: \n \na) K\u0101ma-ta\u1e47h\u0101: craving for sensual pleasures \nb) Bhava-ta\u1e47h\u0101: craving for existence or becoming \nc) Vibhava-ta\u1e47h\u0101: craving for non-existence \n \nIn the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta (SN 56.11), the Buddha says: \n \n\"Now this, monks, is the noble truth of the origin of dukkha: It is this craving which leads to renewed \nexistence, accompanied by delight and lust, seeking delight here and there; that is, craving for sensual \npleasures, craving for existence, craving for extermination.\" \n \nThis perspective focuses more on the psychological aspects of craving - our desire for pleasant \nexperiences, our wish to continue existing, and sometimes our wish to cease existing. \n \nComparison and Synthesis: \n \nWhile these perspectives might seem different, they are not necessarily contradictory. The Mah\u0101y\u0101na \nview can be seen as a deeper analysis of why we crave. The Therav\u0101da categorization describes what we \ncrave. \n \nBoth views agree that craving leads to suffering and that overcoming craving is essential for liberation. \nThe Mah\u0101y\u0101na view suggests that to truly overcome craving, we must realize the empty nature of all \nphenomena. The Therav\u0101da approach often emphasizes directly observing and letting go of craving",

However, the interpretation and emphasis on craving can differ between \nTherav\u0101da and Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism, particularly in terms of craving as attachment to inherent \nexistence versus craving as desire for sensual pleasure and existence. \n \n### Therav\u0101da Buddhism \nIn Therav\u0101da Buddhism, craving is primarily understood as the desire for sensual pleasure, existence, \nand non-existence. It is the second link in the Twelve Nid\u0101nas (Dependent Origination), which \nexplains the cycle of birth and death (sa\u1e43s\u0101ra). \n \n1. **Types of Craving**: \n   - **K\u0101ma-ta\u1e47h\u0101**: Craving for sensual pleasures, such as pleasant sights, sounds, smells, tastes, \nand tactile sensations. \n   - **Bhava-ta\u1e47h\u0101**: Craving for existence or becoming, which includes the desire for continued \nexistence in a particular state or form. \n   - **Vibhava-ta\u1e47h\u0101**: Craving for non-existence or annihilation, which is the desire to escape or \navoid unpleasant experiences. \n \n2. **Role in Suffering**: \n   - Craving is identified as the root cause of suffering (dukkha) in the Second Noble Truth. It leads to \nattachment, clinging, and the perpetuation of the cycle of birth and death. \n   - The cessation of craving is the Third Noble Truth, which leads to the end of suffering and the \nattainment of Nibb\u0101na. \n \n3. **Practice**: \n   - Therav\u0101da practitioners focus on understanding and overcoming craving through the cultivation \nof mindfulness, ethical conduct, and insight meditation (vipassan\u0101). The goal is to see the \nimpermanent, unsatisfactory, and selfless nature of all phenomena, thereby reducing attachment \nand craving. \n \n### Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism \nIn Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism, craving is also seen as a fundamental cause of suffering, but the \ninterpretation often extends to include attachment to inherent existence.

Here\u2019s a comparative look \nat how a practitioner in each tradition might approach meditation: \n \n### Therav\u0101da Buddhism \nIn Therav\u0101da Buddhism, meditation is primarily aimed at developing insight (vipassan\u0101) and \nconcentration (samatha) to achieve personal liberation (Nibb\u0101na). \n \n1. **Samatha (Calm Abiding)**: \n   - **Purpose**: To develop deep states of concentration and mental tranquility. \n   - **Practices**: Common samatha practices include mindfulness of breathing (\u0101n\u0101p\u0101nasati) and \nthe cultivation of the four divine abodes (brahmavih\u0101ras): loving-kindness (mett\u0101), compassion \n(karu\u1e47\u0101), sympathetic joy (mudit\u0101), and equanimity (upekkh\u0101). \n   - **Outcome**: Achieving jh\u0101nas (meditative absorptions), which are states of deep mental focus \nand stillness. \n \n2. **Vipassan\u0101 (Insight)**: \n   - **Purpose**: To develop insight into the true nature of reality, particularly the three marks of \nexistence: impermanence (anicca), suffering (dukkha), and not-self (anatt\u0101). \n   - **Practices**: Mindfulness (sati) is central, often practiced through the Four Foundations of \nMindfulness (satipa\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na): mindfulness of the body, feelings, mind, and mental objects. \n   - **Outcome**: Direct realization of the nature of phenomena, leading to wisdom (pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101) and \nultimately Nibb\u0101na. \n \n3. **Integration**: \n   - **Path**: The Noble Eightfold Path guides the practitioner, with right concentration (samm\u0101 \nsam\u0101dhi) and right mindfulness (samm\u0101 sati) being key components. \n   - **Goal**: Personal liberation and the cessation of suffering through the eradication of \ndefilements (kilesa). \n \n### Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism \nIn Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism, meditation is often integrated with the Bodhisattva path, emphasizing the \ncultivation of bodhicitta (the mind of enlightenment) and the realization of emptiness (\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101). \n \n1. **Samatha and Vipassan\u0101**:",

It is \nthe cessation of suffering and the end of the cycle of birth and death (sa\u1e43s\u0101ra). \n \n- **Nibb\u0101na**: Nibb\u0101na is described as the extinguishing of the fires of greed (lobha), hatred (dosa), \nand delusion (moha). It is a state of perfect peace, freedom, and liberation from all conditioned \nexistence. \n- **Arahant**: The ideal in Therav\u0101da is the *Arahant*, a person who has attained Nibb\u0101na through \ntheir own efforts by following the Noble Eightfold Path. The Arahant has eradicated all defilements \n(kilesa) and will not be reborn. \n- **Personal Liberation**: The focus in Therav\u0101da is on individual liberation. The path involves \nethical conduct (s\u012bla), mental discipline (sam\u0101dhi), and wisdom (pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101) to achieve personal \nenlightenment. \n \n### Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism \nIn Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism, enlightenment is often referred to as *Buddhahood* or *Anuttar\u0101 \nSamyaksa\u1e43bodhi* (unsurpassed complete enlightenment). It encompasses not only personal \nliberation but also the aspiration to help all beings achieve enlightenment. \n \n- **Bodhisattva Ideal**: The ideal in Mah\u0101y\u0101na is the *Bodhisattva*, a being who vows to attain \nBuddhahood for the sake of all sentient beings. The Bodhisattva path involves cultivating \n*bodhicitta*, the altruistic intention to achieve enlightenment to benefit others. \n- **Buddhahood**: Buddhahood in Mah\u0101y\u0101na is characterized by the realization of the ultimate \nnature of reality (\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101) and the perfection of wisdom (praj\u00f1\u0101) and compassion (karu\u1e47\u0101). A \nBuddha is seen as having omniscience and the ability to skillfully guide beings to liberation. \n- **Universal Liberation**: Mah\u0101y\u0101na emphasizes the interconnectedness of all beings and the \naspiration for universal liberation. The path includes the practice of the *Six Perfections* \n(P\u0101ramit\u0101s): generosity, ethical conduct, patience, effort, meditation, and wisdom. \n \n### Key Differences \n1. **Ideal Figure**: Therav\u0101da focuses on the Arahant, who achieves personal liberation, while \nMah\u0101y\u0101na emphasizes the Bodhisattva, who seeks enlightenment for the benefit of all beings.",

Therav\u0101da emphasizes the emptiness of self (anatt\u0101) within the framework of impermanence and not-self, supporting insight meditation for liberation. Mah\u0101y\u0101na expands emptiness to all phenomena, integrating it with bodhicitta and the Bodhisattva path to transcend dualistic thinking and cultivate compassion.\nThe concept of emptiness (\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101) is a profound and central teaching in Buddhism, but its \ninterpretation and emphasis differ significantly between Mah\u0101y\u0101na and Therav\u0101da traditions. \n \n### Therav\u0101da Buddhism \nIn Therav\u0101da Buddhism, the concept of emptiness is primarily understood in the context of the \n*Anatt\u0101* (Pali; Sanskrit: *An\u0101tman*) doctrine, which teaches that there is no permanent, \nunchanging self or soul. Emptiness in this tradition refers to the absence of a self in persons and \nphenomena. \n \n- **Anatt\u0101**: Therav\u0101da emphasizes that all conditioned things (sankh\u0101ra) are impermanent \n(anicca), unsatisfactory (dukkha), and not-self (anatt\u0101). This means that what we consider as \"self\" is \nactually a collection of impermanent, interdependent processes (the five aggregates: form, \nsensation, perception, mental formations, and consciousness). \n- **Emptiness of Self**: Therav\u0101da teachings focus on the emptiness of a self or soul in persons, \nwhich helps practitioners let go of attachment and realize liberation (Nibb\u0101na). \n- **Practical Application**: The understanding of emptiness in Therav\u0101da is often used to support \ninsight meditation (Vipassan\u0101), where practitioners observe the impermanent and selfless nature of \nall phenomena to develop wisdom and attain enlightenment. \n \n### Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism \nIn Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism, the concept of emptiness is more expansive and is a cornerstone of the \nphilosophy. It is deeply explored in texts such as the *Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 Sutras* and the works of \nphilosophers like N\u0101g\u0101rjuna. \n \n- **\u015a\u016bnyat\u0101**: Mah\u0101y\u0101na teaches that all phenomena are empty (\u015b\u016bnya) of inherent existence. This \nmeans that things do not exist independently or possess an intrinsic nature; they are interdependent \nand arise based on causes and conditions (prat\u012btyasamutp\u0101da). \n- **Emptiness of Phenomena**: Unlike Therav\u0101da, which primarily focuses on the emptiness of self, \nMah\u0101y\u0101na extends the concept to all phenomena, asserting that everything is empty of inherent \nexistence. \n- **Madhyamaka School**: Founded by N\u0101g\u0101rjuna, the Madhyamaka (Middle Way) school \nelaborates on the doctrine of emptiness, arguing that all views of inherent existence are extremes \nand that true reality is beyond conceptual elaboration. \n- **Practical Application**: In Mah\u0101y\u0101na, understanding emptiness is crucial for developing \nbodhicitta (the mind of enlightenment) and practicing the Bodhisattva path. It helps practitioners \ntranscend dualistic thinking and cultivate compassion by seeing the interconnectedness of all beings. \n \n### Key Differences",

Compassion in this \ncontext is understood as the desire to alleviate the suffering of others. It is cultivated through \nmeditation practices aimed at developing a heart free from ill-will and filled with empathy for all \nbeings. \n \n- **Scope**: In Therav\u0101da, compassion is often directed towards individuals and is practiced as part \nof the path to personal liberation (arahantship). The focus is on developing a mind that is free from \nhatred and capable of feeling empathy for others' suffering. \n- **Practice**: Compassion is cultivated through specific meditation practices, such as *mett\u0101-\nbh\u0101van\u0101* (loving-kindness meditation), where practitioners extend feelings of goodwill and \ncompassion towards themselves and others. \n \n### Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism \nIn Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism, compassion takes on a more expansive and central role, often being \nequated with the very essence of the Bodhisattva path. The Bodhisattva ideal is to attain \nenlightenment not just for oneself but for the benefit of all sentient beings. \n \n- **Scope**: Compassion in Mah\u0101y\u0101na is universal and all-encompassing. It is not limited to \nalleviating the suffering of individuals but extends to all beings without exception. The ultimate \nexpression of compassion is the Bodhisattva's vow to postpone their own final enlightenment until \nall beings are liberated. \n- **Practice**: Compassion is deeply integrated into all aspects of Mah\u0101y\u0101na practice. The \ncultivation of *bodhicitta* (the mind of enlightenment) is central, which involves the aspiration to \nachieve Buddhahood for the sake of all beings.
